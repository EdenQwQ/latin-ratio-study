The practical use of Kit-Build concept map on formative assessment,2017,37,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056457565&doi=10.1186%2fs41039-017-0060-x&partnerID=40&md5=97b830232a548a9bb370061a6219da19,"Formative assessment can encourage an instructor to improve learning achievements in a lecture class. The goal of formative assessment in a classroom situation is monitoring learners to provide instructor’s feedback for improving learner’s understanding as well as instructor’s expectation. A Kit-Build concept map is a digital tool for supporting a concept map strategy to represent instructor’s expectation and to assess the current understanding of learners. The Kit-Build concept map is also adequate for implementing the formative assessment in a lecture class. The proposition level exact matching between the concept map of instructor and learners can generate the diagnosis results for informing the instructor about the gaps between current learner’s understanding and the instructor’s expectation. Accordingly, the instructor can design the feedback based on the diagnosis results for improving the understanding of learners. In this paper, we propose the arrangement of the ability of the Kit-Build concept map on formative assessment in a lecture class for creating an opportunity to assess current understanding of learners as more as possible. And we present the effectiveness of the Kit-Build concept map on the closed-end approach in elementary school through three practical uses in various lecture classes, which illustrate the contribution of the Kit-Build concept map when utilized on formative assessment in the lecture class. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.4413145539906103
Industrial–educational collaboration case study for fur design education,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034438184&doi=10.1186%2fs40691-017-0096-y&partnerID=40&md5=f10bbb4ea089916e816284dd570642a7,"This paper is a case study on industrial–educational collaboration program between KF and SNU for fur design education. Industrial-educational collaboration program was done by Royal Danish Embassy in South Korea in commemoration of the 55th anniversary of both nations’ diplomatic ties. Major tasks of industrial–educational collaboration are as follows. For 3 years from 2014 to 2016, fur design education workshops and fashion shows were held in Seoul of South Korea and Copenhagen of Denmark under mutual cooperation. The goal of a workshop was development of various and creative fur designs along with popularization of fur industry. It has significance in that it contributed to the development of fur industry through creative fur design education for superior students of the world and provided them with opportunities to expand a scope of design through experiencing materials. Future fur industry and global fashion design are expected to develop with much interest and participation through such a successful industrial–educational collaboration program. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.4551282051282051
Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis of a Nonlinear Dynamic Factor Analysis Model with Nonparametric Prior and Possible Nonignorable Missingness,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031431399&doi=10.1007%2fs11336-017-9587-4&partnerID=40&md5=dcc3569789c70578ce235c07e1c071e0,"Many psychological concepts are unobserved and usually represented as latent factors apprehended through multiple observed indicators. When multiple-subject multivariate time series data are available, dynamic factor analysis models with random effects offer one way of modeling patterns of within- and between-person variations by combining factor analysis and time series analysis at the factor level. Using the Dirichlet process (DP) as a nonparametric prior for individual-specific time series parameters further allows the distributional forms of these parameters to deviate from commonly imposed (e.g., normal or other symmetric) functional forms, arising as a result of these parameters’ restricted ranges. Given the complexity of such models, a thorough sensitivity analysis is critical but computationally prohibitive. We propose a Bayesian local influence method that allows for simultaneous sensitivity analysis of multiple modeling components within a single fitting of the model of choice. Five illustrations and an empirical example are provided to demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in facilitating the detection of outlying cases and common sources of misspecification in dynamic factor analysis models, as well as identification of modeling components that are sensitive to changes in the DP prior specification. © 2017, The Psychometric Society.",0.5287958115183246
The effect of migration on social capital and depression among older adults in China,2017,51,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029538649&doi=10.1007%2fs00127-017-1439-0&partnerID=40&md5=6831b7021596b0b255c326f63d0585bd,"Purpose: An estimated 9 million elderly people accompanied their adult children to urban areas in China, raising concerns about their social capital and mental health following re-location. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of migration on social capital and depression among this population. Methods: Multistage stratified cluster sampling was applied to recruit the migrant and urban elderly in Hangzhou from May to August, 2013. Data were collected from face-to-face interviews by trained college students using a standardized questionnaire. Social capital measurements included cognitive (generalized trust and reciprocity) and structure (support from individual and social contact) aspects. Depression was measured by Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS-30). Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression models were used for analysis. Results: A total of 1248 migrant elderly and 1322 urban elderly were eligible for analysis. After adjusting for a range of confounder factors, binary logistic regression models revealed that migrant elderly reported significantly lower levels of generalized trust [OR = 1.34, 95% CI (1.10–1.64)], reciprocity [OR = 1.55, 95% CI (1.29–1.87)], support from individual [OR = 1.96, 95% CI (1.61–2.38)] and social contact [OR = 3.27, 95% CI (2.70–3.97)]. In the full adjusted model, migrant elderly were more likely to be mentally unhealthy [OR = 1.85, 95% CI (1.44–2.36)] compared with urban elderly. Conclusions: Migrant elderly suffered from a lower mental health status and social capital than their urban counterparts in the emigrating city. Attention should focus on improving the social capital and mental health of this growing population. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.5176991150442478
Electroconvulsive therapy selectively enhanced feedforward connectivity from fusiform face area to amygdala in major depressive disorder,2017,81,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041675821&doi=10.1093%2fscan%2fnsx100&partnerID=40&md5=25c39a1ede8233dd7513afbc9cdcd0ec,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been widely used to treat the major depressive disorder (MDD), especially for treatment-resistant depression. However, the neuroanatomical basis of ECT remains an open problem. In our study, we combined the voxel-based morphology (VBM), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify the longitudinal changes of structure and function in 23 MDD patients before and after ECT. In addition, multivariate pattern analysis using linear support vector machine (SVM) was applied to classify 23 depressed patients from 25 gender, age and education matched healthy controls. VBM analysis revealed the increased gray matter volume of left superficial amygdala after ECT. The following RSFC and GCA analyses further identified the enhanced functional connectivity between left amygdala and left fusiform face area (FFA) and effective connectivity from FFA to amygdala after ECT, respectively. Moreover, SVM-based classification achieved an accuracy of 83.33%, a sensitivity of 82.61% and a specificity of 84% by leave-one-out cross-validation. Our findings indicated that ECT may facilitate the neurogenesis of amygdala and selectively enhance the feedforward cortical-subcortical connectivity from FFA to amygdala. This study may shed new light on the pathological mechanism of MDD and may provide the neuroanatomical basis for ECT. © The Author (2017). Published by Oxford University Press.",0.4797979797979798
Comparison of brain connectivity between Internet gambling disorder and Internet gaming disorder: A preliminary study,2017,22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039761676&doi=10.1556%2f2006.6.2017.061&partnerID=40&md5=90f8bfbd8cf331efdfe9d7b8c2b15dd8,"Background and aims: Given the similarities in clinical symptoms, Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is thought to be diagnostically similar to Internet-based gambling disorder (ibGD). However, cognitive enhancement and educational use of Internet gaming suggest that the two disorders derive from different neurobiological mechanisms. The goal of this study was to compare subjects with ibGD to those with IGD. Methods: Fifteen patients with IGD, 14 patients with ibGD, and 15 healthy control subjects were included in this study. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data for all participants were acquired using a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Seed-based analyses, the three brain networks of default mode, cognitive control, and reward circuitry, were performed. Results: Both IGD and ibGD groups demonstrated decreased functional connectivity (FC) within the default-mode network (DMN) (family-wise error p < .001) compared with healthy control subjects. However, the IGD group demonstrated increased FC within the cognitive network compared with both the ibGD (p < .01) and healthy control groups (p < .01). In contrast, the ibGD group demonstrated increased FC within the reward circuitry compared with both IGD (p < .01) and healthy control subjects (p < .01). Discussion and conclusions: The IGD and ibGD groups shared the characteristic of decreased FC in the DMN. However, the IGD group demonstrated increased FC within the cognitive network compared with both ibGD and healthy comparison groups. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.3778801843317972
Altered sulcogyral patterns of orbitofrontal cortex in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026239839&doi=10.1038%2fs41537-016-0008-y&partnerID=40&md5=b1ececd031b358347b60ec61676467d4,"Abnormalities in prenatal brain development contribute to schizophrenia vulnerability. Orbitofrontal cortex sulcogyral patterns are largely determined during prenatal development, and four types of orbitofrontal cortex sulcogyral patterns have been classified in humans. Altered orbitofrontal cortex patterns have been reported in individuals with schizophrenia using magnetic resonance imaging; however, sample sizes of previous studies were small-medium effects for detection, and gender manifestation for orbitofrontal cortex sulcogyral patterns is unclear. The present study investigated orbitofrontal cortex patterns of 155 patients with schizophrenia and 375 healthy subjects. The orbitofrontal cortex sulcogyral pattern distributions of schizophrenia were significantly different compared with healthy subjects in the left hemisphere (X2 = 14.55, p = 0.002). In female schizophrenia, post-hoc analyses revealed significantly decreased Type I expression (X2 = 6.76, p = 0.009) and increased Type II expression (X2 = 11.56, p = 0.001) in the left hemisphere. The present study suggested that female schizophrenia showed altered orbitofrontal cortex patterns in the left hemisphere, which may be related to neurodevelopmental abnormality. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.47368421052631576
Classroom practice for understanding pointers using learning support system for visualizing memory image and target domain world,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060064478&doi=10.1186%2fs41039-017-0058-4&partnerID=40&md5=2b0fa73fa0bb6028849aab195cbd592b,"Pointers are difficult learning targets for novice learners of C programming. For such difficult targets, introducing a system visualizing program behaviors is generally expected to support learners to understand the targets. However, visualization in existing systems often conceals the concrete value of variables such as pointers; the way in which each visualized object is located on the memory is not made explicit. In order to address this issue, we focused on a program visualization system called TEDViT. It visualizes simultaneously and synchronously the memory image that is the field that presents the concrete value of variables and the target domain world that is the field that presents logically the data structures processed by the program. We consider that observing and comparing program code, memory image, and target domain world with TEDViT could work for understanding pointers. TEDViT visualizes the status of the target domain world according to the visualization policy defined by the teacher in order to allow teachers to set their instruction content based on the growing variety of learner background knowledge. We also consider that this feature could support teachers’ instructions and class managements appropriately, and improving teachers’ performance by TEDViT’s support would bring improvement of learners’ understanding. We conducted classroom practice for understanding pointers in connection with a memory model, thus introducing TEDViT to a real class. Analysis of answered scores in a questionnaire conducted after the practice suggests that our practice using TEDViT provided useful supports for participants to understand pointers. It also suggests our practice had a certain effect to reduce uneven levels of understanding among participants. Based on these results, we describe that classroom practices in our framework could support learners to understand pointers and support teachers to manage the class. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.4083044982698962
Do children with better inhibitory control donate more?

However, it is not clear at what developmental stage inhibitory control becomes associated with donating behavior and which aspects of inhibitory control are related to donating behavior during development in early to middle childhood. The present study aimed to clarify these issues with two experiments. In Experiment 1, 103 3- to 5-year-old preschoolers completed cool (Stroop-like) and hot (delay of gratification) inhibitory control tasks and a donating task. The results indicated that there were no relationships between cool or hot inhibitory control and donating behavior in the whole group and each age group of the preschoolers. In Experiment 2, 140 elementary school children in Grades 2, 4, and 6 completed cool (Stroop-like) and hot (delay of gratification) inhibitory control tasks and a donating task. The results showed that inhibitory control was positively associated with donating behavior in the whole group. Cool and hot inhibitory control respectively predicted donating behavior in the second and sixth graders. Therefore, the present study reveals that donating behavior increasingly relies on specific inhibitory control, i.e., hot inhibitory control as children grow in middle childhood. © 2017 Hao.",0.44086021505376344
Associations between functional connectivity dynamics and BOLD dynamics are heterogeneous across brain networks,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041049860&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00593&partnerID=40&md5=846c960e6a9c9fd32d1795c5d932f60f,"Functional brain imaging has revealed two types of dynamic patterns of brain in the resting-state: the dynamics of spontaneous brain activities and the dynamics of functional interconnections between spontaneous brain activities. Although these two types of brain dynamics are usually investigated separately in the literature, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that they exhibit similar spatial patterns, suggesting the dynamics of spontaneous brain activities and the dynamics of their interconnections are associated with each other. In this study, we characterized the local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics and the functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) in the resting-state, and then investigated their between-region associations. Time-varying FC was estimated as time-varying correlation coefficients using a sliding-window method, and the temporal variability of BOLD and time-varying FC were used to quantify the BOLD dynamics and the FCD, respectively. Our results showed that the BOLD dynamics and the FCD exhibit similar spatial patterns, and they are significantly associated across brain regions. Importantly, such associations are opposite for different types of FC (e.g., within-network FCD are negatively correlated with the BOLD dynamics but the between-network FCD are positively correlated with the BOLD dynamics), and they are spatially heterogeneous across brain networks. The identified heterogeneous associations between the BOLD dynamics and the FCD appear to convey related or even distinct information and might underscore the potential mechanism of brain coordination and co-evolution. © 2017 Fu, Tu, Di, Biswal, Calhoun and Zhang.",0.4406779661016949
What does eye-blink rate variability dynamics tell us about cognitive performance?,2017,36,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041000592&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00620&partnerID=40&md5=238241c9cc3d3be997bcf340001fb68d,"Cognitive performance is defined as the ability to utilize knowledge, attention, memory, and working memory. In this study, we briefly discuss various markers that have been proposed to predict cognitive performance. Next, we develop a novel approach to characterize cognitive performance by analyzing eye-blink rate variability dynamics. Our findings are based on a sample of 24 subjects. The subjects were given a 5-min resting period prior to a 10-min IQ test. During both stages, eye blinks were recorded from Fp1 and Fp2 electrodes. We found that scale exponents estimated for blink rate variability during rest were correlated with subjects’ performance on the subsequent IQ test. This surprising phenomenon could be explained by the person to person variation in concentrations of dopamine in PFC and accumulation of GABA in the visual cortex, as both neurotransmitters play a key role in cognitive processes and affect blinking. This study demonstrates the possibility that blink rate variability dynamics at rest carry information about cognitive performance and can be employed in the assessment of cognitive abilities without taking a test. © 2017 Paprocki and Lenskiy.",0.4293785310734463

Existing theories and empirical findings suggest that achievement goals are potentially related to life satisfaction. However, the relationship between achievement goals and life satisfaction remains relatively unexplored in the psychology literature. In this study, we examined how, why, and when achievement goals affect life satisfaction using original survey data from China. The results suggest that achievement goals were positively related to life satisfaction (R2 = .20, 90% CI [.11, .26]), that the perception of successful agency fully mediated the relationship between achievement goals and life satisfaction (R2 = .22, 90% CI [.12, .27]), and that emotion reappraisal moderated the relationship between achievement goals and life satisfaction (R2 = .34, 90% CI [.23, .39]).

Relationship between self-rated health and lifestyle and food habits in Japanese high school students,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064269762&doi=10.3390%2fbs7040071&partnerID=40&md5=b63b7eb35d4fcd1bc855b1fb7cf54f03,"Self-rated health (SRH), a subjective assessment of health status, is extensively used in the field of public health. It is an important and valid measure that is strongly related to morbidity, mortality, longevity and health status. Adolescence is a crucial period for the formation of health status, because health-risk behaviours (e.g., skipping breakfast) are often established during this period. In this study, we investigated the relationship of SRH with lifestyle and eating habits in Japanese high school students. In this study, 1296 students aged 16-18 years from 11 high schools in Japan participated. A questionnaire was administered to these participants that included a question on SRH, five questions on demographic characteristics, six questions on lifestyle items (e.g., wake-up time), five questions on miscellaneous health issues (e.g., anorexia), and 25 questions on food habits and attitudes towards food. We examined the differences between self-rated healthy and unhealthy groups using logistic regression analysis adjusted for gender and age. A dichotomy regression analysis was performed using a stepwise elimination method. Of the 1296 respondents, 16.7%reported feeling unhealthy, 57.7%of whom were females. The self-rated healthy group had a higher frequency of eating breakfast (odds ratio (OR): 2.13; confidence interval (CI): 1.07-4.24) and liked home meals to a greater extent (OR: 3.12; CI: 1.27-7.65) than the self-rated unhealthy group. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of other lifestyle factors or unidentified complaints. Our results suggest that liking home meals during adolescence may lead to the development of good eating habits, i.e., eating breakfast, and better SRH. © 2017 by the authors.

Chinese participants were asked to listen to a spoken disyllabic compound word while simultaneously viewing a printed-word display. Each visual display consisted of three printed words: a semantic associate of the first constituent of the compound word (morphemic competitor), a semantic associate of the whole compound word (whole-word competitor), and an unrelated word (distractor). Participants were directed to detect whether the spoken target word was on the visual display. Results indicated that both the morphemic and whole-word competitors attracted more fixations than the distractor. More importantly, the morphemic competitor began to diverge from the distractor immediately at the acoustic offset of the first constituent, which was earlier than the whole-word competitor. These results suggest that lexical access to the auditory word is incremental and morphological processing (i.e., semantic access to the first constituent) that occurs at an early processing stage before access to the representation of the whole word in Chinese. © 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.38235294117647056

Methods: A total of 1,015 secondary school students from Guangzhou in China participated in a cross-sectional survey. Levels of depression, insomnia, IA, and OSNA were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire, and Online Social Networking Addiction Scale, respectively. Logistic regression models were fit to test the associations between IA, OSNA, insomnia, and depression. The mediation effects of insomnia were tested using Baron and Kenny's strategy. Results: The prevalence of depression at moderate level or above (CES-D ≥ 21), insomnia, IA, and OSNA were 23.5%, 37.2%, 8.1%, and 25.5%, respectively. IA and OSNA were significantly associated with depression (IA: AOR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.71, 4.55; OSNA: AOR = 3.27, 95% CI: 2.33, 4.59) and insomnia (IA: AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.72, 4.65; OSNA: AOR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.61, 2.96), after adjusting for significant background factors. Furthermore, insomnia partially mediated 60.6% of the effect of IA on depression (Sobel Z = 3.562, p < .002) and 44.8% of the effect of OSNA on depression (Sobel Z = 3.919, p < .001), respectively. Discussion: The high prevalence of IA and OSNA may be associated with increased risk of developing depression among adolescents, both through direct and indirect effects (via insomnia). Findings from this study indicated that it may be effective to develop and implement interventions that jointly consider the problematic Internet use, insomnia, and depression. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.48497854077253216
Semantic radicals contribute more than phonetic radicals to the recognition of Chinese Phonograms: Behavioral and ERP evidence in a factorial study,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038368249&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02230&partnerID=40&md5=bc0244dba6edd8465df5465a3b4067e1,"The Chinese phonograms consist of a semantic radical and a phonetic radical. The two types of radicals have different functional contributions to their host phonogram. The semantic radical typically signifies the meaning of the phonogram, while the phonetic radical usually contains a phonological clue to the phonogram's pronunciation. However, it is still unclear how they interplay with each other when we attempt to recognize a phonogram because previous studies rarely manipulated the functionality of the two types of radicals in a single design. Using a full factorial design, the present study aimed to probe this issue by directly manipulating the functional validity of the two types of radicals in a lexical decision task with both behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measurements. The results showed that recognition of phonograms which were related to their semantic radicals in meaning took a shorter reaction time, showed a lower error rate, and elicited a smaller P200 and a larger N400 than did recognition of those which had no semantic relation with their semantic radicals. However, the validity of phonetic radicals did not show any main effect or interaction with that of semantic radicals on either behavioral or ERP measurements. These results indicated that semantic radicals played a dominant role in the recognition of phonograms. Transparent semantic radicals, which provide valid semantic cues to phonograms, can facilitate the recognition of phonograms. © 2017 Wang, Pei, Wu and Su.",0.42857142857142855
Visual search for wines with a triangle on the label in a virtual store,2017,27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037854698&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02173&partnerID=40&md5=ac676d4eea20424db309f9ea1e540cda,"Two experiments were conducted in a virtual reality (VR) environment in order to investigate participants' in-store visual search for bottles of wines displaying a prominent triangular shape on their label. The experimental task involved virtually moving along a wine aisle in a virtual supermarket while searching for the wine bottle on the shelf that had a different triangle on its label from the other bottles. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that the participants identified the bottle with a downward-pointing triangle on its label more rapidly than when looking for an upward-pointing triangle on the label instead. This finding replicates the downward-pointing triangle superiority (DPTS) effect, though the magnitude of this effect was more pronounced in the first as compared to the second half of the experiment, suggesting a modulating role of practice. The results of Experiment 2 revealed that the DPTS effect was also modulated by the location of the target on the shelf. Interestingly, however, the results of a follow-up survey demonstrate that the orientation of the triangle did not influence the participants' evaluation of the wine bottles. Taken together, these findings reveal how in-store the attention of consumers might be influenced by the design elements in product packaging. These results therefore suggest that shopping in a virtual supermarket might offer a practical means of assessing the shelf standout of product packaging, which has important implications for food marketing. © 2017 Zhao, Huang, Spence and Wan.",0.3888888888888889
Pragmatic ability deficit in schizophrenia and associated theory of mind and executive function,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037739863&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02164&partnerID=40&md5=8690142b17d48d44a95bac0e26e37cc6,"Deficits in pragmatic abilities have frequently been observed in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between pragmatic deficits, ToM deficits and executive dysfunctions in schizophrenia. A group of 42 schizophrenic patients and 42 healthy controls were assessed on irony task (one type of pragmatic language), two subcomponents of ToM (cognitive and affective), and three subcomponents of EF (inhibition, updating, and switching). The clinical symptoms in schizophrenia were assessed using the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The schizophrenia group exhibited significant impairments in all above tasks compared to the control group. Correlation results found that irony scores were correlated with the two subcomponents of ToM and two of the three subcomponents of EF (inhibition and updating). The regression analysis revealed that the cognitive ToM and inhibition predicted 9.2% and 29.9% of the variance of irony comprehension in the patient group, and inhibition was the best predictor for performance on irony task. Irony understanding was related to positive symptoms, but not to negative symptoms. The results suggest that the ability to interpret pragmatic language depends on schizophrenic patients' ability to infer mental states and the ability of inhibition. It provides empirical evidence for a particular target of inhibition for rehabilitation and intervention programs developed for schizophrenic patients. © 2017 Li, Hu, Deng, Tao, Hu, Yang, Wang, Tao, Yang and Zhang.",0.4727272727272727
How are changes in exposure to job demands and job resources related to burnout and engagement?

On the basis of the job demands–resources model and conservation of resources (COR) theory, increases in demands and decreases in resources across time were expected to result in unfavorable changes in well-being across time. The results of a 2-wave study among 172 nurses and 273 police officers showed several common patterns across both samples: (a) participants who experienced an increase of demands showed a significant increase in burnout, whereas participants who reported having low resources at both measurement times also showed a significant increase in burnout; (b) participants who experienced decreasing resources reported a significant increase in burnout and a significant decrease in engagement; (c) participants who were exposed to chronic low job resources in a highly demanding environment showed a significant increase in burnout; and (d) participants who were exposed to decreased job resources in a highly demanding environment showed a significant increase in burnout.

Environmentally benign Fe(III)–montmorillonite for rapid adsorption of methylene blue dye in aqueous medium under ambient conditions,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034419704&doi=10.1186%2fs40691-017-0087-z&partnerID=40&md5=c6705c9f1c4bfc920a6c39255102ae03,"Herein we have explored the highly efficient and environmentally benign clay mineral, Fe(III)–montmorillonite [Fe(III)–Mt], for adsorption of methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solution under ambient conditions. The Fe(III)–Mt was interacted with MB dye solution at different pH, temperature and solid-to-liquid ratio. The concentration of MB dye removal was estimated from its optical density at λmax = 665 nm using UV–Vis spectrophotometer. The MB dye removal was rapid at basic pH and increases with temperature up to 40 °C. A complete reduction (100%) was occurred in about 7 min at pH 7 and 10 while at pH 3 in about 10 min. The time taken for complete reduction at 0, 30 and 40 °C are 10, 7 and 5 min respectively. The removal followed by adsorption of dye molecules on the spent clay mineral was evident from FESEM/EDX analysis. More importantly, Fe(III)–Mt could be separated and retrieved easily after the reaction by centrifugation from the degraded MB dye solution. The experimental results of MB dye removal from Fe(III)–Mt follows the pseudo first order kinetics. This study reveals that Fe(III)–Mt has the potential to be used as reductant/adsorbant to remove cationic pollutants effectively and rapidly from drinking water and large scale of industrial wastewater. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.4052631578947368

Previous research has focused on the classification, functions, and other aspects of these two affects. However, few studies have been conducted on the relationship between love and hate. The present study investigated whether similarity within romantic partners was associated with greater feelings of love in the absence of betrayal, and greater hate induced in the presence of betrayal by using vignettes to induce love and hate in a sample of 59 young adults. The results showed that people who shared similar values and interests with the target persons were more likely to experience stronger love. Additionally, stronger feelings of love were associated with greater hate after the relationship was broken, suggesting a link between romantic love and hate. Our study revealed a complex picture of love and hate. People have different emotional reactions toward different target persons in the context of romantic love and hate. If one loves someone deeply and sometimes hates that person, the feeling of love may still be dominant in the context of betrayal. However, if one does not love that person, hate will be a much stronger feeling than love. © 2017 Jin, Xiang and Lei.",0.4512820512820513

Based on a survey of 311 doctors from five government teaching hospitals in Pakistan, we used structural equation modeling and bootstrapping to test these relationships. This study reveals that psychological wellbeing significantly fully mediates the positive relationship between workplace romance and job performance. Moreover, multi-group analysis shows that gender moderates the indirect effect of workplace romance on employee performance, where the indirect effect of workplace romance on employee performance is stronger for male participants.

Here we conducted a randomized, double-blind, SHAM-controlled study to assess the effects of high-frequency left DLPFC rTMS on resting-state activity. Thirty-eight young healthy subjects received two sessions of either real rTMS (N = 18, 90% motor-threshold; left DLPFC at 20 Hz) or SHAM TMS (N = 20) and functional magnetic resonance imaging scan during rest in 2 days separated by 48 h. Resting-state bran activity was measured with the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and functional connectivity (FC). Increased fALFF was found in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) after 20 Hz rTMS, while no changes were observed after SHAM stimulation. Using the suprathreshold rACC cluster as the seed, increased FC was found in left temporal cortex (stimulation vs. group interaction). These data suggest that high-frequency rTMS on left DLPFC enhances low-frequency resting-state brain activity in the target site and remote sites as reflected by fALFF and FC. © 2017 Xue, Guo, Peng, Zhang, Chang, Zang and Wang.",0.3756906077348066
Forming facial expressions influences assessment of others' dominance but not trustworthiness,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036524705&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02097&partnerID=40&md5=0178900a19d8f9bc1a09ef93f400840a,"Forming specific facial expressions influences emotions and perception. Bearing this in mind, studies should be reconsidered in which observers expressing neutral emotions inferred personal traits from the facial expressions of others. In the present study, participants were asked to make happy, neutral, and disgusted facial expressions: for ""happy,"" they held a wooden chopstick in their molars to form a smile; for ""neutral,"" they clasped the chopstick between their lips, making no expression; for ""disgusted,"" they put the chopstick between their upper lip and nose and knit their brows in a scowl. However, they were not asked to intentionally change their emotional state. Observers judged happy expression images as more trustworthy, competent, warm, friendly, and distinctive than disgusted expression images, regardless of the observers' own facial expression. Observers judged disgusted expression images as more dominant than happy expression images. However, observers expressing disgust overestimated dominance in observed disgusted expression images and underestimated dominance in happy expression images. In contrast, observers with happy facial forms attenuated dominance for disgusted expression images. These results suggest that dominance inferred from facial expressions is unstable and influenced by not only the observed facial expression, but also the observers' own physiological states. © 2017 Ueda, Nagoya, Yoshikawa and Nomura.",0.48258706467661694
The influence of concreteness of concepts on the integration of novel words into the semantic network,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036614310&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02111&partnerID=40&md5=9b311502e1b3926425a44975c38a10cc,"On the basis of previous studies revealing a processing advantage of concrete words over abstract words, the current study aimed to further explore the influence of concreteness on the integration of novel words into semantic memory with the event related potential (ERP) technique. In the experiment during the learning phase participants read two-sentence contexts and inferred the meaning of novel words. The novel words were two-character non-words in Chinese language. Their meaning was either a concrete or abstract known concept which could be inferred from the contexts. During the testing phase participants performed a lexical decision task in which the learned novel words served as primes for either their corresponding concepts, semantically related or unrelated targets. For the concrete novel words, the semantically related words belonged to the same semantic categories with their corresponding concepts. For the abstract novel words, the semantically related words were synonyms of their corresponding concepts. The unrelated targets were real words which were concrete or abstract for the concrete or abstract novel words respectively. The ERP results showed that the corresponding concepts and the semantically related words elicited smaller N400s than the unrelated words. The N400 effect was not modulated by the concreteness of the concepts. In addition, the concrete corresponding concepts elicited a smaller late positive component (LPC) than the concrete unrelated words. This LPC effect was absent for the abstract words. The results indicate that although both concrete and abstract novel words can be acquired and linked to their related words in the semantic network after a short learning phase, the concrete novel words are learned better. Our findings support the (extended) dual coding theory and broaden our understanding of adult word learning and changes in concept organization. © 2017 Ding, Liu and Yang.",0.4532871972318339

The post hoc modification model approach attempts to improve CFA fit through the use of modification indexes for identifying significant correlated residual error terms. We analyzed a 28-item emotion measure collected for n 175 participants. The post hoc modification approach indicated that 90 item-pair errors were significantly correlated, which demonstrated the challenge in using a modification index, as the error terms must be individually modified as a sequence. Additionally, the post hoc modification approach cannot guarantee a positive definite covariance matrix for the error terms. We propose a method that enables the entire inverse residual covariance matrix to be modeled as a sparse positive definite matrix that contains only a few off-diagonal elements bounded away from zero. This method circumvents the problem of having to handle correlated residual terms sequentially. By assigning a Lasso prior to the inverse covariance matrix, this Bayesian method achieves model parsimony as well as an identifiable model. Both simulated and real data sets were analyzed to evaluate the validity, robustness, and practical usefulness of the proposed procedure. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.5396039603960396

Therefore, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate the neural generators of alpha-band (8–13 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) occurring from 600 to 900 ms following the onset of a critical sentence at which social situational contexts activated ironic representation. We found that the right anterior temporal lobe, which is involved in processing social knowledge and evaluating others’ intentions, exhibited stronger alpha ERD following an ironic statement than following a literal statement. We also found that alpha power in the left anterior temporal lobe correlated with the participants’ communication abilities. These results elucidate the temporospatial neural mechanisms of language comprehension in social contexts, including non-literal processing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.44366197183098594

However, limited data exist on the role of the SMA in music. Music performance requires complex information processing in auditory, visual, spatial, emotional, andmotor domains, and this information is integrated for the performance. We hypothesized that the SMA is engaged in multimodal integration of information, distributed across several regions of the brain to prepare for ongoing music performance. To test this hypothesis, functional networks involving the SMA were extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that were acquired from musicians during imagined music performance and during the resting state. Compared with the resting condition, imagined music performance increased connectivity of the SMA with widespread regions in the brain including the sensorimotor cortices, parietal cortex, posterior temporal cortex, occipital cortex, and inferior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Increased connectivity of the SMA with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex suggests that the SMA is under cognitive control, while increased connectivity with the inferior prefrontal cortex suggests the involvement of syntax processing. Increased connectivity with the parietal cortex, posterior temporal cortex, and occipital cortex is likely for the integration of spatial, emotional, and visual information. Finally, increased connectivity with the sensorimotor cortices was potentially involved with the translation of thought planning into motor programs. Therefore, the reconfiguration of the SMA network observed in this study is considered to reflect the multimodal integration required for imagined and actual music performance.We propose that the SMA network construct “the internal representation of music performance” by integrating multimodal information required for the performance. © 2017 Tanaka and Kirino.",0.5055350553505535

However, little is known regarding whether SCH is associated with structural or functional alterations in the Hb. In this study, we combined structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the changes in volume and functional connectivity of the Hb in 15 patients with SCH vs. 16 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs). Morphologically, the absolute volume of the bilateral Hb was significantly lower in the SCH patients than in the HCs. Functionally, the bilateral Hb showed significantly enhanced functional connectivity with the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the SCH patients. Additionally, the SCH patients exhibited increased functional connectivity of the left Hb with the left lingual gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). A further exploratory analysis revealed that the SCH patients showed increased functional connectivity between the right Hb and several subcortical regions related to dopaminergic pathways, including the left ventral striatum, caudate and putamen. Finally, the increased functional connectivity of the right Hb with the mPFC was positively correlated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores in the patients. Together, these results suggest that the altered volume and functional connectivity of the Hb may be involved in the pathogenesis of SCH and thus that the Hb may serve as a potential target in developing new therapeutic strategies in SCH. © 2017 Zhang, Wang, Luan, Yang, Wang, Wang and Zhao.",0.36254980079681276

Here we investigated at both physiological and behavioral level whether a prolonged limb immobilization affects body ownership. We tested a group of healthy participants, whose left-hand movements were prevented by a cast for one week, and a control group without any movement restriction. In both groups, we measured the strength of the rubber hand illusion (i.e., proprioceptive shift and questionnaire on ownership) and the physiological parameters known to be modulated by short-term arm immobilization (i.e., resting motor threshold, motor evoked potentials and force parameters) before and after the week of immobilization. Our results showed stronger illusory effects on the immobilized hand on both behavioral indexes and weaker illusory effects on the non-immobilized hand on the questionnaire. Additionally, the increased proprioceptive shift was positively correlated to the motor threshold of the contralateral hemisphere. Our findings show at both behavioral and physiological level that altering those movement-related signals which constantly stem from our own body parts, modulates the experience of those body parts as mine. This, in turn, supports the view of a direct role of actions in the developing and maintaining a coherent body ownership. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.424390243902439

Sleep patterns and their association with depression and behavior problems among Chinese adolescents in different grades,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038927391&doi=10.1002%2fpchj.189&partnerID=40&md5=80554cf80286fad47f7114230308b0a2,"We aimed to examine sleep patterns and their association with depression and behavior problems among Chinese adolescents in different grades. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 cities of mainland China. A total of 8,998 Chinese adolescents (49.3% males) aged 9–20 years completed a self-administered questionnaire that included questions on sleep patterns, depressive symptoms, behavior problems, and demographic characteristics. The percentage of adolescents who slept less than 7 hr on weekdays increased with grade, while the percentage of adolescents who slept less than 7 hr on weekends remained the same. The gap in sleep length between weekdays and weekends increased from 0.6 hr in grade 5 to 2.3 hr in Grade 12. The regression analysis showed that poor sleep habits were linked to greater emotional and behavioral problems. The associations of sleep length with those problems differed by symptom and grade. Sleeping less related to depression in all grades. More behavior problems were observed in primary school students who had less sleep and in senior high school students who had more sleep than their peers. The preference for going to bed late stably related to both adolescent depression and behavior problems in all grades, although it posed a greater risk for students in higher grades. © 2017 The Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",0.41148325358851673
Impulsivity and compulsivity in Internet gaming disorder: A comparison with obsessive-compulsive disorder and alcohol use disorder,2017,41,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039786355&doi=10.1556%2f2006.6.2017.069&partnerID=40&md5=4ff60ce01cbcde16c729fbde17fd75e7,"Background and aims: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is characterized by a loss of control and a preoccupation with Internet games leading to repetitive behavior. We aimed to compare the baseline neuropsychological profiles in IGD, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in the spectrum of impulsivity and compulsivity. Methods: A total of 225 subjects (IGD, N = 86; AUD, N = 39; OCD, N = 23; healthy controls, N = 77) were administered traditional neuropsychological tests including Korean version of the Stroop Color-Word test and computerized neuropsychological tests, including the stop signal test (SST) and the intra-extra dimensional set shift test (IED). Results: Within the domain of impulsivity, the IGD and OCD groups made significantly more direction errors in SST (p = .003, p = .001) and showed significantly delayed reaction times in the color-word reading condition of the Stroop test (p = .049, p = .001). The OCD group showed the slowest reading time in the color-word condition among the four groups. Within the domain of compulsivity, IGD patients showed the worst performance in IED total trials measuring attentional set shifting ability among the groups. Conclusions: Both the IGD and OCD groups shared impairment in inhibitory control functions as well as cognitive inflexibility. Neurocognitive dysfunction in IGD is linked to feature of impulsivity and compulsivity of behavioral addiction rather than impulse dyscontrol by itself. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.3791469194312796

These data were previously reported for each specific country. In these analyses, educators’ conceptual understandings and pedagogical practices relating to ECEfS are explored. Many of the pedagogical practices that are evident in each national context are guided by country-specific policies, educational systems, and curriculum guidelines. Overall, the respondents from the three countries reported that they practised traditional nature-based activities extensively, such as gardening and playing outdoors, and educators taught intentionally about nature. Australian and Korean educators prioritised pedagogies relating to resource conservation and environmental issues, while Japanese educators’ survey responses indicated a reluctance to focus on these aspects of sustainability. The introduction of national guidelines is important as a driver to enhance educators’ understandings about sustainability within specific countries. A key recommendation is the need for targeted strategies for professional development in order to deepen educators’ understandings and improve practices for sustainability in early childhood programs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",0.4375
Exploring the Social Needs and Challenges of Chinese American Immigrant Breast Cancer Survivors: a Qualitative Study Using an Expressive Writing Approach,2017,53,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020190224&doi=10.1007%2fs12529-017-9661-4&partnerID=40&md5=961f374f5661bce77ede41b5c5ad19e2,"Purpose: Little is known about the psychological well-being and social barriers among immigrant Chinese American breast cancer survivors. The aim of the present study was to explore the social needs and challenges of Chinese American immigrant breast cancer survivors. Method: This study used the expressive writing approach to explore the experiences among 27 Chinese American breast cancer survivors. The participants were recruited through community-based organizations in Southern California, most of whom were diagnosed at stages I and II (33 and 48%, respectively). Participants, on average, had been living in the USA for 19 years. Participants were asked to write three 20-min essays related to their experience with breast cancer (in 3 weeks). Participants’ writings were coded with line-by-line analysis, and categories and themes were generated. Results: Emotion suppression, self-stigma, and perceived stigma about being a breast cancer survivor were reflected in the writings. Interpersonally, participants indicated their reluctance to disclose cancer diagnosis to family and friends and concerns about fulfilling multiple roles. Some of them also mentioned barriers of communicating with their husbands. Related to life in the USA, participants felt unfamiliar with the healthcare system and encountered language barriers. Conclusion: Counseling services addressing concerns about stigma and communication among family members may benefit patients’ adjustments. Tailor-made information in Chinese about diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer and health insurance in the USA may also help patients go through the course of recovery. © 2017, International Society of Behavioral Medicine.",0.4592274678111588
Does gender matter in the relationship between anxiety and decision-making?,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038362761&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02231&partnerID=40&md5=c7f0d477062dddff92860ba0802903dd,"There is an ongoing debate about whether and how anxiety level affects behavioral performance in risk and/or ambiguous decision-making. According to the literature, we suggest that gender difference might be a confounding factor that has contributed to heterogeneous findings in previous studies. To examine this idea, 135 students who participated in this study were divided into six groups according to their gender (male/female) and trait anxiety level (high/medium/low; measured by the Trait form of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). All groups finished the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) for ambiguous decision-making, and the Game of Dice Task (GDT) for risk decision-making. Behavioral results revealed that the IGT but not the GDT showed an interaction between anxiety and gender. Specifically, men outperformed women in the IGT, but only when their trait anxiety levels were low. Meanwhile, the GDT showed a main effect of anxiety grouping, such that low anxious participants were more risk-seeking than their medium anxious counterparts. These findings indicate that gender selectively modulates the influence of anxiety on ambiguous decision-making, but not risk decision-making. The theoretical and practical implications of the current findings are discussed. © 2017 Zhang, Xiao and Gu.",0.45454545454545453

A growing number of studies have investigated the brain structures and neural connectivities associated with perceived emotions. However, very little is known about the effect of an explicit act of judgment on the neural processing of emotionally-valenced music. In this study, we adopted the novel consensus clustering paradigm, called binarisation of consensus partition matrices (Bi-CoPaM), to study whether and how the conscious aesthetic evaluation of the music would modulate brain connectivity networks related to emotion and reward processing. Participants listened to music under three conditions - one involving a non-evaluative judgment, one involving an explicit evaluative aesthetic judgment, and one involving no judgment at all (passive listening only). During non-evaluative attentive listening we obtained auditory-limbic connectivity whereas when participants were asked to decide explicitly whether they liked or disliked the music excerpt, only two clusters of intercommunicating brain regions were found: one including areas related to auditory processing and action observation, and the other comprising higher-order structures involved with visual processing. Results indicate that explicit evaluative judgment has an impact on the neural auditory-limbic connectivity during affective processing of music. © 2017 Manippa, Padulo, van der Laan and Brancucci.",0.517948717948718
Functions of learning rate in adaptive reward learning,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041034300&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00592&partnerID=40&md5=cb17e56649504fa14dd1540da755cddf,"As a crucial cognitive function, learning applies prediction error (the discrepancy between the prediction from learning and the world state) to adjust predictions of the future. How much prediction error affects this adjustment also depends on the learning rate. Our understanding to the learning rate is still limited, in terms of (1) how it is modulated by other factors, and (2) the specific mechanisms of how learning rate interacts with prediction error to update learning. We applied computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate these issues. We found that, when human participants performed a reward learning task, reward magnitude modulated learning rate. Modulation strength further predicted the difference in behavior following high vs. low reward across subjects. Imaging results further showed that this modulation was reflected in brain regions where the reward feedback is also encoded, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (MFC), precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, for the first time, we observed that the integration of the learning rate and the reward prediction error was represented in MFC activity. These findings extend our understanding of adaptive learning by demonstrating how it functions in a chain reaction of prediction updating. © 2017 Wu, Wang, Liu, Wu, Jiang, Zhou and Zhou.",0.485
Electroconvulsive therapy-induced brain functional connectivity predicts therapeutic efficacy in patients with schizophrenia: A multivariate pattern recognition study,2017,27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045153976&doi=10.1038%2fs41537-017-0023-7&partnerID=40&md5=21d4237125dd81c892c7b6a1110a3c40,"Previous studies suggested that electroconvulsive therapy can influence regional metabolism and dopamine signaling, thereby alleviating symptoms of schizophrenia. It remains unclear what patients may benefit more from the treatment. The present study sought to identify biomarkers that predict the electroconvulsive therapy response in individual patients. Thirty-four schizophrenia patients and 34 controls were included in this study. Patients were scanned prior to treatment and after 6 weeks of treatment with antipsychotics only (n = 16) or a combination of antipsychotics and electroconvulsive therapy (n = 13). Subject-specific intrinsic connectivity networks were computed for each subject using a group information-guided independent component analysis technique. Classifiers were built to distinguish patients from controls and quantify brain states based on intrinsic connectivity networks. A general linear model was built on the classification scores of first scan (referred to as baseline classification scores) to predict treatment response. Classifiers built on the default mode network, the temporal lobe network, the language network, the corticostriatal network, the frontal-parietal network, and the cerebellum achieved a cross-validated classification accuracy of 83.82%, with specificity of 91.18% and sensitivity of 76.47%. After the electroconvulsive therapy, psychosis symptoms of the patients were relieved and classification scores of the patients were decreased. Moreover, the baseline classification scores were predictive for the treatment outcome. Schizophrenia patients exhibited functional deviations in multiple intrinsic connectivity networks which were able to distinguish patients from healthy controls at an individual level. Patients with lower classification scores prior to treatment had better treatment outcome, indicating that the baseline classification scores before treatment is a good predictor for treatment outcome. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.41106719367588934

Aberrant functional network connectivity as a biomarker of generalized anxiety disorder,2017,56,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041008689&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00626&partnerID=40&md5=abeaf22c105d56c27bb67d82e45f180f,"Neural disruptions during emotion regulation are common of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Identifying distinct functional and effective connectivity patterns in GAD may provide biomarkers for their diagnoses. This study aims to investigate the differences of features of brain network connectivity between GAD patients and healthy controls (HC), and to assess whether those differences can serve as biomarkers to distinguish GAD from controls. Independent component analysis (ICA) with hierarchical partner matching (HPM-ICA) was conducted on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 20 GAD patients with medicine-free and 20 matched HC, identifying nine highly reproducible and significantly different functional brain connectivity patterns across diagnostic groups. We then utilized Granger causality (GC) to study the effective connectivity between the regions that identified by HPM-ICA. The linear discriminant analysis was finally used to distinguish GAD from controls with these measures of neural connectivity. The GAD patients showed stronger functional connectivity in amygdala, insula, putamen, thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex, but weaker in frontal and temporal cortex compared with controls. Besides, the effective connectivity in GAD was decreased from the cortex to amygdala and basal ganglia. Applying the ICA and GC features to the classifier led to a classification accuracy of 87.5%, with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 85.0%. These findings suggest that the presence of emotion dysregulation circuits may contribute to the pathophysiology of GAD, and these aberrant brain features may serve as robust brain biomarkers for GAD. © 2017 Qiao, Li, Cao, Wang, Sun and Xu.",0.46887966804979253
Brain-to-brain synchronization across two persons predicts mutual prosociality,2017,116,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042219862&doi=10.1093%2fscan%2fnsx118&partnerID=40&md5=3cc5c898b780e5064b4756493f104789,"People tend to be more prosocial after synchronizing behaviors with others, yet the underlying neural mechanisms are rarely known. In this study, participant dyads performed either a coordination task or an independence task, with their brain activations recorded via the functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning technique. Participant dyads in the coordination group showed higher synchronized behaviors and greater subsequent inclination to help each other than those in the independence group, indicating the prosocial effect of interpersonal synchrony. Importantly, the coordination group demonstrated the significant task-related brain coherence, namely the interbrain synchronization, at the left middle frontal area. The detected interbrain synchronization was sensitive to shared intentionality between participants and was correlated with the mutual prosocial inclination. Further, the task-related brain coherence played a mediation role in the prosocial effect of interpersonal synchrony. This study reveals the relevance of brain-to-brain synchronization among individuals with subsequent mutual prosocial inclination and suggests the neural mechanism associating with shared cognition for the facilitation of interpersonal synchrony on prosociality. © The Author (2017).

It considers the application of Goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals to early childhood education to ensure that inclusive and equitable quality education that promotes lifelong learning opportunities is available to all children. Early childhood practitioners and researchers are encouraged to implement curricula and pedagogies that can support sustainable learning. While educational research about sustainability is necessary, understandings of sustainability policies and values are also required. Values related to sustainability promote a certain type of pedagogy in which the child should be allowed to take initiatives, think, and reflect. This requires high-quality early childhood education. How sustainability concepts can be applied to both content and pedagogy are discussed, as well as different preconditions that are necessary so that all children can access education for sustainability. Important preconditions of education for sustainability include a need for awareness that lifelong learning is applicable to early childhood education, as well as educated staff who are aware about what is relevant for young children to learn about sustainability. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.398876404494382

They are extremely important to the social interaction of individuals. Background scenes in which faces are perceived provide important contextual information for facial expression processing. The purpose of this study was to explore the time course of emotional congruency effects in processing faces and scenes simultaneously by recording event-related potentials (ERPs). The behavioral results found that the categorization of facial expression was faster and more accurate when the face was emotionally congruent than incongruent with the emotion displayed by the scene. In ERPs the late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes were modulated by the emotional congruency between faces and scenes. Specifically, happy faces elicited larger LPP amplitudes within positive than within negative scenes and fearful faces within negative scenes elicited larger LPP amplitudes than within positive scenes. The results did not find the scene effects on the P1 and N170 components. These findings indicate that emotional congruency effects could occur in late stages of facial expression processing, reflecting motivated attention allocation. © 2017 Xu, Yang, Tan and Zhang.",0.5055555555555555
Frequency-specific functional connectivity density as an effective biomarker for adolescent generalized anxiety disorder,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040980983&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00549&partnerID=40&md5=eb0c876d74782b4c052b73d3cd5354c3,"Several neuropsychiatric diseases have been found to influence the frequency-specific spontaneous functional brain organization (SFBO) in resting state, demonstrating that the abnormal brain activities of different frequency bands are associated with various physiological and psychological dysfunctions. However, little is known about the frequency specificities of SFBO in adolescent generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Here, a novel complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise method was applied to decompose the time series of each voxel across all participants (31 adolescent patients with GAD and 28 matched healthy controls; HCs) into four frequency-specific bands with distinct intrinsic oscillation. The functional connectivity density (FCD) of different scales (short-range and long-range) was calculated to quantify the SFBO changes related to GAD within each above frequency-specific band and the conventional frequency band (0.01-0.08 Hz). Support vector machine classifier was further used to examine the discriminative ability of the frequencyspecific FCD values. The results showed that adolescent GAD patients exhibited abnormal alterations of both short-range and long-range FCD (S-FCD and L-FCD) in widespread brain regions across three frequency-specific bands. Positive correlation between the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) score and increased L-FCD in the fusiform gyrus in the conventional frequency band was found in adolescents with GAD. Both S-FCD and L-FCD in the insula in the lower frequency band (0.02-0.036 Hz) had the highest classification performance compared to all other brain regions with inter-group difference. Furthermore, a satisfactory classification performance was achieved by combining the discrepant S-FCD and L-FCD values in all frequency bands, with the area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9414 and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 87.15, 92.92, and 89.83%, respectively. This study indicates that the alterations of SFBO in adolescent GAD are frequency dependence and the frequencyspecific FCD can potentially serve as a valuable biomarker in discriminating GAD patients from HCs.

Dependency distance, the linear distance between two syntactically related words in a sentence, is an index of sentence complexity and is also able to reflect the cognitive constraints during various tasks. In the current research, we examine the difference in dependency distance among three interpreting types, namely, simultaneous interpreting, consecutive interpreting and read-out translated speech based on a treebank comprising these types of interpreting output texts with dependency annotation. Results show that different interpreting renditions yield different dependency distances, and consecutive interpreting texts entail the smallest dependency distance other than those of simultaneous interpreting and read-out translated speech, suggesting that consecutive interpreting bears heavier cognitive demands than simultaneous interpreting. The current research suggests for the first time that interpreting is an extremely demanding cognitive task that can further mediate the dependency distance of output sentences. Such findings may be due to the minimization of dependency distance under cognitive constraints. © 2017 Liang, Fang, Lv and Liu.",0.5029585798816568

However, limited research has been conducted on moderators of these relations, despite the argument that the associations between parenting practices and children's psychological adjustment are probabilistic rather than deterministic. This study examined the mediating role of children's emotion regulation in linking parents' emotion socialization and children's psychological adjustment, and whether dyadic collaboration could moderate the proposed mediation model in a sample of Chinese parents and their children in their middle childhood. Participants were 150 Chinese children (87 boys and 63 girls, Mage = 8.54, SD = 1.67) and their parents (Mage = 39.22, SD = 4.07). Parent-child dyadic collaboration was videotaped and coded from an interaction task. Parents reported on their emotion socialization, children's emotion regulation and psychopathological symptoms. Results indicated that child emotion regulation mediated the links between parental emotion socialization and child's psychopathological symptoms. Evidence of moderated mediation was also found: supportive emotion socialization and child emotion regulation were positively correlated only at high and medium levels of dyadic collaboration, with child's psychopathological symptoms as the dependent variables. Our findings suggested that higher-level parent-child collaboration might further potentiate the protective effect of parental supportive emotion socialization practices against child psychopathological symptoms. © 2017 Jin, Zhang and Han.",0.40654205607476634

The model's fit indices indicated a good fit (CFI = 0.996, TLI = 0.962, NFI = 0.994, RMSEA = 0.055). Results showed that a positive cognition coping style mediated the relationship between personality and PTG. © 2017 An, Ding and Fu.",0.45384615384615384
Being eager to prove oneself: U-shaped relationship between competence frustration and intrinsic motivation in another activity,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037743745&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02123&partnerID=40&md5=79702b283a62f430f80df53686824c2a,"Competence frustration has been consistently found to undermine one's intrinsic motivation in the same activity. However, the relationship between competence frustration in a preceding activity and one's intrinsic motivation in a subsequent one remains unclear. In order to explore this relationship, self-reported data were collected from 617 undergraduate students of a large comprehensive university in southern China, who took varied courses immediately before taking a less-demanding one. Results suggested a U-shaped relationship between students' competence frustration in a preceding course and intrinsic motivation in a subsequent one. To be specific, for students whose competence frustration reached the inflection point, a restoration process would be activated if the current course would help restore their competence. Importantly, these students' competence frustration in a preceding course was found to positively predict their intrinsic motivation level in a subsequent course. As far as we are concerned, this is the first study to reveal a potential positive effect of need frustration outside of its primary thwarting context, which complements and extends existing literatures on the dynamics between need frustration and intrinsic motivation. © 2017 Fang, He, Fu and Meng.",0.5082872928176796
A generalized extensive structure that is equipped with a right action and its representation,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029616153&doi=10.1016%2fj.jmp.2017.09.001&partnerID=40&md5=22a60e4eddba9f26de65b2251fed71eb,"In intertemporal choice, it has been found that if the receipt time is closer to the present, then people tend to grow increasingly or decreasingly impatient. This paper develops an axiom system to construct a weighted additive model reflecting nonconstant impatience. By presupposing that an increment in duration is subjectively assessed according to the periods at which advancement occurs, we denote the one-period advanced receipt of outcomes by multiplying the outcomes by the increment on the right. By this right multiplication, we can regard the effect of advance as the decomposition into two factors, i.e., the factor of step-by-step advance accompanied by subdivided durations and the factor of advance based on the total duration. First, the conditions for enabling right multiplication are proposed for the Cartesian product of the underlying set of a generalized extensive structure and a set of durations. Second, the properties derived under these conditions yield a right action on the generalized extensive structure. Finally, the weighted additive model is obtained as a representation of the generalized extensive structure equipped with the right action. © 2017 The Author",0.43575418994413406
Global electroencephalography synchronization as a new indicator for tracking emotional changes of a group of individuals during video watching,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040975787&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00577&partnerID=40&md5=1a8f42d3b9db1a145c2973d8e8bb633f,"In the present study, we investigated whether global electroencephalography (EEG) synchronization can be a new promising index for tracking emotional arousal changes of a group of individuals during video watching. Global field synchronization (GFS), an index known to correlate with human cognitive processes, was evaluated; this index quantified the global temporal synchronization among multichannel EEG data recorded from a group of participants (n = 25) during the plays of two short video clips. The two video clips were each about 5min long and were designed to evoke negative (fearful) or positive (happy) emotion, respectively. Another group of participants (n = 37) was asked to select the two most emotionally arousing (most touching or most fearful) scenes in each clip. The results of these questionnaire surveys were used as the ground-truth to evaluate whether the GFS could detect emotional highlights of both video clips. The emotional highlights estimated using the grand-averaged GFS waveforms of the first group were also compared with those evaluated from galvanic skin response, photoplethysmography, and multimedia content analysis, which are conventional methods used to estimate temporal changes in emotional arousal during video plays. From our results, we found that beta-band GFS values decreased during high emotional arousal, regardless of the type of emotional stimulus. Moreover, the emotional highlights estimated using the GFS waveforms coincided best with those found by the questionnaire surveys. These findings suggest that GFS might be applicable as a new index for tracking emotional arousal changes of a group of individuals during video watching, and is likely to be used to evaluate or edit movies, TV commercials, and other broadcast products. © 2017 Han, Lee, Lim, Kim and Im.",0.3643122676579926

Specifically, we examined the concept of perceived chronic social adversity and its assessment, the Perceived Chronic Social Adversity Questionnaire (PCSAQ). The PCSAQ focused on the subjective processing of daily social experiences. Psychometric properties were examined within two non-clinical samples (N = 331 and N = 390) and one clinical sample (N = 86). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor model of the PCSAQ, which corresponds to three types of daily social stressors. The final 28-item PCSAQ was shown to be internally consistent, and to have good construct validity in terms of factor structure and group differences. It was also shown to have good concurrent validity in terms of association with outcome variables (sense of control, happiness, and mood and anxiety symptoms). Perceived chronic social adversity was also shown to be correlated with PTSD severity. Taken together, these findings suggest that the PCSAQ is a reliable, valid, and useful measure that can be used to assess negative social and clinical aspects of personal experiences. This study is an important exploratory step in improving our understanding of the relationship between the cumulative effect of negative social encounters and psychological difficulty. © 2017 Zhang, Ding, Tang, Zhang and Yang.",0.4854368932038835

Eye movement (EM) recordings showed that compared to LHD men, HHD men had an avoidance bias in response to height-related words, which was revealed by less frequent first fixations on both tall-related and short-related words, and showed significantly shorter first fixations on short-related words. There was no other significant difference in EM indices (i.e., first fixation latency and gaze duration) between two groups. In addition, HHD participants were significantly slower than LHD participants when responding to probes preceded by short-related words, while there was no difference when probes were preceded by tall-related or neutral words.

Focusing on 5- to 6-year old children, the current study employed eye-tracking in an odd-one-out task (searching for the emotional facial expression among neutral expressions, N = 47) and a pain evaluation task (evaluating the pain intensity of a facial expression, N = 42) to investigate the relationship between children's empathy and their behavioral and perceptual response to facial pain expression. We found children detected painful expression faster than others (angry, sad, and happy), children high in empathy performed better on searching facial expression of pain, and gave higher evaluation of pain intensity; and rating for pain in painful expressions was best predicted by a self-reported empathy score. As for eye-tracking in pain detection, children fixated on pain more quickly, less frequently and for shorter times. Of facial clues, children fixated on eyes and mouth more quickly, more frequently and for longer times. These results implied that painful facial expression was different from others in a cognitive sense, and children's empathy might facilitate their search and make them perceive the intensity of observed pain on the higher side. © 2017 Yan, Pei and Su.",0.4293193717277487

This pattern was unaffected by manipulations of stimulus type (faces vs. scenes), encoding duration (limited vs. self-paced), and presentation format (simultaneous vs. sequential). We also found that the similarity effects differed in strength in different categories (scenes vs. faces).

Few studies have reported LTrP risk factors. It has been suggested that alexithymia is associated with myofascial pain and diminished awareness of physical sensation. This study was designed to evaluate the relation between alexithymia and LTrPs found the upper trapezius of healthy individuals. Methods: The correlation between LTrPs and alexithymia, and between LTrPs and depression was analyzed in 160 healthy participants (80 male, mean age: 40.5 years [20 to 66 years]). Each participant was evaluated for potential LTrPs by careful manual examination and completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess potential alexithymia and depressive symptoms, respectively. Results: LTrPs were observed in the upper trapezius of 76 participants (47.5%). TAS-20 scores were significantly higher in subjects with LTrPs than without LTrPs (p < 0.001); in contrast, there was no significant BDI score difference between these groups (p = 0.451). The LTrP risk for alexithymia was 2.74 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.10-3.58). There was no correlation between the TAS-20 and BDI scores (correlation coefficient: -0.04). Significant risk factors associated with LTrPs included the TAS-20 score (odds ratio [OR]: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.07-1.15) and age (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09).

Although significant concerns have been made about the health effects of smartphone addiction, the relationship between smartphone addiction and accidents has rarely been studied. We examined the association between smartphone addiction and accidents among South Korean university students. Methods: A total of 608 college students completed an online survey that included their experience of accidents (total number; traffic accidents; falls/slips; bumps/collisions; being trapped in the subway, impalement, cuts, and exit wounds; and burns or electric shocks), their use of smartphone, the type of smartphone content they most frequently used, and other variables of interests. Smartphone addiction was estimated using Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale, a standardized measure developed by the National Institution in Korea. Results: Compared with normal users, participants who were addicted to smartphones were more likely to have experienced any accidents (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.26-2.86), falling from height/slipping (OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.10-3.91), and bumps/ collisions (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.16-2.87). The proportion of participants who used their smartphones mainly for entertainment was significantly high in both the accident (38.76%) and smartphone addiction (36.40%) groups. Discussion and conclusions: We suggest that smartphone addiction was significantly associated with total accident, falling/slipping, and bumps/collisions. This finding highlighted the need for increased awareness of the risk of accidents with smartphone addiction. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.42105263157894735

In total, 113 Mandarin-speaking Chinese children, 100 Korean children, 112 English-speaking Canadian children, and 108 Greek children in Grade 3 were administered tasks of serial and discrete naming of words and digits. Interrelations among tasks indicated that the link between rapid naming and reading is largely determined by the format of the tasks across orthographies. Multigroup path analyses with discrete and serial word reading as dependent variables revealed commonalities as well as significant differences between writing systems. The path coefficient from discrete digits to discrete words was greater for the more transparent orthographies, consistent with more efficient sight-word processing. The effect of discrete word reading on serial word reading was stronger in alphabetic languages, where there was also a suppressive effect of discrete digit naming. However, the effect of serial digit naming on serial word reading did not differ among the four language groups. This pattern of relationships challenges a universal account of reading fluency acquisition while upholding a universal role of rapid serial naming, further distinguishing between multi-element interword and intraword processing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.48936170212765956

Methods A sample of 74 752 adults from five provinces that account for >12% of China's adult population was screened using the General Health Questionnaire, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was administered by psychiatrists to a subsample of 9619 males. The associations between AUD and other mental disorders at each site and the characteristics of men with AUD with and without comorbid mental disorders were estimated using logistic regression and summarized across sites using meta-analysis. Generalized estimation equations estimated the associations between the clinical features of alcohol dependence and comorbidity. Results Robust inverse associations were found between current AUD and any mood disorder (adjusted OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-0.8) and any anxiety disorder (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-1.0). Compared with men without AUD, men with AUD without comorbid disorders were more likely to be middle-aged, to be currently married, and to have higher family incomes. Men with comorbid AUD and other disorders were more likely to have the clinical features of alcohol dependence than men with AUD without comorbid disorders. Conclusions Inverse associations between AUD and other mental disorders and the higher social status of men with AUD than men without AUD found in this large, representative sample of community-dwelling Chinese males highlight the importance of considering the local substance-use culture when designing clinical or preventive interventions for addictive conditions. © Cambridge University Press.",0.43902439024390244

(Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 2017) found that when reading two-character Chinese words embedded in sentence contexts, contextual diversity (CD), a measure of the proportion of texts in which a word appears, affected fixation times to words. When CD is controlled, however, frequency did not affect reading times. Two experiments used the same experimental designs to examine whether there are frequency effects of the first character of two-character words when CD is controlled. In Experiment 1, yoked triples of characters from a control group, a group matched for character CD that is lower in frequency, and a group matched in frequency with the control group, but higher in character CD, were rotated through the same sentence frame. In Experiment 2 each character from a larger set was embedded in a separate sentence frame, allowing for a larger difference in log frequency compared to Experiment 1 (0.8 and 0.4, respectively). In both experiments, early and later eye movement measures were significantly shorter for characters with higher CD than for characters with lower CD, with no effects of character frequency. These results place constraints on models of visual word recognition and suggest ways in which Chinese can be used to tease apart the nature of context effects in word recognition and language processing in general. © 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4858490566037736

Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that inequitable decisions are related to brain regions that associated with negative emotion and signaling conflict. In the highly complex human social environment, our opinions and behaviors can be affected by social information. In current study, we used a modified dictator game to investigate the effect of social influence on making an equitable decision. We found that the choices of participants in present task was influenced by the choices of peers. However, participants' decisions were influenced by equitable rather than inequitable group choices. fMRI results showed that brain regions that related to norm violation and social conflict were related to the inequitable social influence. The neural responses in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, rostral cingulate zone, and insula predicted subsequent conforming behavior in individuals. Additionally, psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that the interconnectivity between the dorsal striatum and insula was elevated in advantageous inequity influence versus no-social influence conditions. We found decreased functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and insula, supplementary motor area, posterior cingulate gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in the disadvantageous inequity influence versus no-social influence conditions. This suggests that a disadvantageous inequity influence may decrease the functional connectivity among brain regions that are related to reward processes. Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying social influence in an equitable decision may be similar to those implicated in social norms and reward processing. © 2017 Wei, Zhao and Zheng.",0.5084033613445378

However, due to the poor BCI performance, this technique is still far from daily-life applications. One of critical issues confronting BCI research is how to enhance BCI performance. This study aimed at improving the motor imagery (MI) based BCI accuracy by integrating MI tasks with unilateral tactile stimulation (Uni-TS). The effects were tested on both healthy subjects and stroke patients in a controlled study. Twenty-two healthy subjects and four stroke patients were recruited and randomly divided into a control-group and an enhanced-group. In the control-group, subjects performed two blocks of conventional MI tasks (left hand vs. right hand), with 80 trials in each block. In the enhanced-group, subjects also performed two blocks of MI tasks, but constant tactile stimulation was applied on the non-dominant/paretic hand during MI tasks in the second block. We found the Uni-TS significantly enhanced the contralateral cortical activations during MI of the stimulated hand, whereas it had no influence on activation patterns during MI of the non-stimulated hand. The two-class BCI decoding accuracy was significantly increased from 72.5% (MI without Uni-TS) to 84.7% (MI with Uni-TS) in the enhanced-group (p < 0.001, paired t-test). Moreover, stroke patients in the enhanced-group achieved an accuracy >80% during MI with Uni-TS. This novel approach complements the conventional methods for BCI enhancement without increasing source information or complexity of signal processing. This enhancement via Uni-TS may facilitate clinical applications of MI-BCI. © 2017 Shu, Yao, Sheng, Zhang and Zhu.",0.3673469387755102

However, little is known about the melodic features of spontaneous cries in preterm infants, who have a higher risk of later language-related problems. Thus, the present study investigated how preterm birth influenced melodic features of spontaneous crying at term-equivalent age as well as how these melodic features related to language outcomes at 18 months of corrected age in preterm and term infants. At term, moderate-to-late preterm (MLP) infants showed spontaneous cries with significantly higher F0 variation and melody complexity than term infants, while there were no significant differences between very preterm (VP) and term infants. Furthermore, larger F0 variation within cry series at term was significantly related to better language and cognitive outcomes, particularly expressive language skills, at 18 months. On the other hand, no other melodic features at term predicted any developmental outcomes at 18 months. The present results suggest that the additional postnatal vocal experience of MLP preterm infants increased F0 variation and the complexity of spontaneous cries at term. Additionally, the increases in F0 variation may partly reflect the development of voluntary vocal control, which, in turn, contributes to expressive language in infancy.",0.5181818181818182

However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relation. The aimof this study was to investigate (a) the mediating role of self-esteem in the association between student-student relationship and smartphone addiction, and (b) the moderating role of the need to belong in the indirect relationship between student-student relationship and adolescent smartphone addiction. Methods: This model was examined with 768 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 16.81 years, SD = 0.73); the participants completed measurements regarding student-student relationship, selfesteem, the need to belong, and smartphone addiction. Results: The correlation analyses indicated that student-student relationship was significantly negatively associated with adolescent smartphone addiction, and the need to belong was significantly positively associated with adolescent smartphone addiction. Mediation analyses revealed that self-esteem partially mediated the link between student-student relationship and adolescent smartphone addiction. Moderated mediation further indicated that the mediated path was weaker for adolescents with lower levels of the need to belong. Discussion and conclusion: High self-esteem could be a protective factor against smartphone addiction for adolescents with a strong need to belong as these students appeared to be at elevated risk of developing smartphone addiction. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.41232227488151657

However, the application is limited due its low mechanical strength. In this study, polyamide 6 (PA6) was blended with PS to improve the mechanical strength of PS, by means of a multi-jet electrospinning. Content ratio of the blend web was measured by chemical immersion test and confocal microscopy analysis. Fiber content was in accordance with the number of syringes used for PS and PA6 respectively. The effects of content ratio on the web morphology, thermal resistance, tensile behavior, air and water vapor permeability, and surface hydrophilicity were investigated. The influence of environmental humidity during electrospinning process on three dimensional (3D) web structure was also reported. PS web produced from higher humidity had more pores and corrugations at the surface. The increased surface roughness and porosity led to the increased hydrophobicity and thermal resistance. Though the blending of PA6 with PS enhanced the mechanical strength, the added PA6 decreased air/water vapor permeability and thermal resistance. The lowered thermal resistance by the addition of PA6 was mainly attributed to higher thermal conductivity of PA6 material and lowered air content with PA6 fibers. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.39487179487179486
Psychopathy moderates the relationship between orbitofrontal and striatal alterations and violence: The investigation of individuals accused of homicide,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041049718&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00579&partnerID=40&md5=2a0e26bf530fff861e07f14967658b61,"Brain structural abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum (caudate and putamen) have been observed in violent individuals. However, a uni-modal neuroimaging perspective has been used and prior findings have been mixed. The present study takes the multimodal structural brain imaging approaches to investigate the differential gray matter volumes (GMV) and cortical thickness (CTh) in the OFC and striatum between violent (accused of homicide) and non-violent (not accused of any violent crimes) individuals with different levels of psychopathic traits (interpersonal and unemotional qualities, factor 1 psychopathy and the expressions of antisocial disposition and impulsivity, factor 2 psychopathy). Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging data, psychopathy and demographic information were assessed in sixty seven non-violent or violent adults. The results showed that the relationship between violence and the GMV in the right lateral OFC varied across different levels of the factor 1 psychopathy. At the subcortical level, the psychopathy level (the factor 1 psychopathy) moderated the positive relationship of violence with both left and right putamen GMV as well as left caudate GMV. Although the CTh findings were not significant, overall findings suggested that psychopathic traits moderated the relationship between violence and the brain structural morphology in the OFC and striatum. In conclusion, psychopathy takes upon a significant role in moderating violent behavior which gives insight to design and implement prevention measures targeting violent acts, thereby possibly mitigating their occurrence within the society. © 2017 Lam, Yang, Schug, Han, Liu and Lee.",0.452991452991453
An analysis of learner outputs in problem posing as sentence-integration in arithmetic word problems,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053882376&doi=10.1186%2fs41039-017-0049-5&partnerID=40&md5=b9d354f35b46202953e17a8205b3965e,"Achieving practical implementation of learning by problem posing faces the issue of inefficiency due to the time needed for assessment and giving feedback to students’ posed problems. As a solution of this problem, we have developed a tablet PC-based software for learning by posing arithmetic word problems named Monsakun. The software is based on Triplet Structure Model of arithmetic word problem. In this research, we investigated problems posed by elementary school students in Monsakun to understand whether Monsakun encourages them to think about the structure of arithmetic word problems. The result shows that students did not pose problems randomly but considered things first. We also found that the frequent errors are actually meaningful errors, and students tried to pose problems satisfying as many constraints as possible, which means they actually think about the structure to pose required problems in the assignments. The process of understanding assignment requirements and relating them to suitable sentence cards is an important point especially for young learners to reach deep understanding of the structure of arithmetic word problems. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.45714285714285713
Regulating rumination by anger: Evidence for the Mutual Promotion and Counteraction (MPMC) theory of emotionality,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036580922&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01871&partnerID=40&md5=ee6972dafb48f7f99a454713fafae3ad,"Unlike the strategy of cognitive regulation that relies heavily on the top-down control function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which was recently found may be critically impaired in stressful situations, traditional Chinese philosophy and medicine views different types of emotionality as having mutual promotion and counteraction (MPMC) relationships, implying a novel approach that requires less cognition to emotional regulation. Actually, our previous studies have indicated that anger responses could be successfully regulated via the induction of sadness, and this efficiency could not be influenced by stress, thus providing evidences for the hypothesis of ""sadness counteracts anger"" (SCA) proposed by the MPMC theory of emotionality (Zhan et al., 2015, 2017). In this study, we experimentally examined the MPMC hypothesis that ""anger counteracts rumination"" (ACR) which postulates that rumination may be alleviated by the anger emotion. In Study 1, all participants were initially caused state rumination and then induced anger, joy or neutral mood, the results showed that the rumination-related affect was alleviated after anger induction relative to that after joy or neutral mood induction. In Study 2, female participants with high trait rumination were recruited and divided into two groups for exposure to an anger or neutral emotion intervention, the result indicated that the anger intervention group exhibited a greater decline in trait rumination than the neutral emotion intervention group. These findings provided preliminary evidence supporting the hypothesis of ACR, which suggested a new strategy that employs less cognitive resources to regulating state and trait rumination by inducing anger. © 2017 Zhan, Tang, He, Fan, Xiao, Liu and Luo.",0.4603174603174603

Korean uses a different word (i.e., netha) for loose-fits (e.g., apple in bowl). We tested whether these differences influence the attention of the speaker. In a crosslinguistic study, we compared native German speakers with native Korean speakers. Participants rated the similarity of two successive video clips of several scenes where two objects were joined or nested (either in a tight or loose manner). The rating data show that Korean speakers base their rating of similarity more on tight-versus loose-fit, whereas German speakers base their rating more on containment versus support (in vs. auf). Throughout the experiment, we also measured the participants' eye movements. Korean speakers looked equally long at the moving Figure object and at the stationary Ground object, whereas German speakers were more biased to look at the Ground object. Additionally, Korean speakers also looked more at the region where the two objects touched than did German speakers.

Flexibility of the trunk and upper and lower limbs was measured using plastic tape and a goniometer, respectively. Joint proprioception (joint position sense) of the upper and lower limbs on land and underwater was measured by an active joint angle repositioning test. Principle outcome measures were passive joint range of motion (flexibility) and active joint repositioning error (proprioception). Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that, compared with control swimmers, synchronized swimmers had greater passive joint ranges of motion in the spinal and upper and lower limb joints (p <.05) and fewer active joint repositioning errors in the shoulder, wrist, and ankle on land (p <.05) and in the hip and ankle underwater (p <.05).

Impact of response stimulus interval on transfer of non-local dependent rules in implicit learning: An ERP investigation,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037083891&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02107&partnerID=40&md5=0d8c4df200ce9732b12ffb096efae972,"In the literature on implicit learning, controversy exists regarding whether the knowledge obtained from implicit sequence learning consists of context-bound superficial features or context-free structural rules. To explore the nature of implicit knowledge, event related potentials (ERP) recordings of participants' performances in a non-local dependent transfer task under two response-stimulus-interval (RSI) conditions (250 and 750 ms) were obtained. In the behavioral data, a transfer effect was found in the 750 ms RSI condition but not in the 250 ms RSI condition, suggesting that a long RSI is the basis for the occurrence of non-local dependent transfer, as which might have provided enough reaction time for participants to process and capture the implicit rule. Moreover, P300 amplitude was found to be sensitive to the impact of RSI on the training process (i.e., the longer RSI elicited higher P300 amplitudes), while variations in both N200 (i.e., a significant increase) and P300 amplitudes (i.e., a significant decrease) were found to be related to the presence of a transfer effect. Our results supported the claim that implicit learning can involve abstract rule knowledge acquisition under an appropriate RSI condition, and that amplitude variation in early ERP components (i.e., N200 and P300) can be useful indexes of non-local dependent learning and transfer effects. © 2017 Huang, Dai, Ye, Zhu, Li and Liu.",0.45023696682464454

Test 1 is whether the model provides reasonably new insights. Test 2 is on whether these have been properly applied to policy settings. Test 3 is whether they are corroborated by evidence. We exemplify by considering the cases of social interactions models, self-control models and, in relation to health message framing, prospect theory. Out of these sets of models, only a correctly applied prospect theory fully passes the tests at present. Specifically, in broad agreement with the evidence, a gain frame has positive implications for welfare encourages disease prevention activity, though this does not apply if the perceived probability of the bad health outcome is large enough. We see our tests as being useful to identify how much health policy weight policy makers should assign to specific behavioral economic models; they are also useful to verify what next steps would be most useful in further research. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.41975308641975306
Longitudinal course of eating disorders after transsexual treatment: A report of two cases,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038355095&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0118-4&partnerID=40&md5=187ab27cb74f04118ba3f000f5973f93,"Background: Several reports have been published on patients with gender dysphoria and eating disorders. However, there have been few reports on the longitudinal course of eating disorders after gender reassignment surgery (GRS)/gender confirmation surgery (GCS). Case presentation: We report two Japanese cases of transsexual persons with eating disorders who underwent GRS/GCS, one male-to-female (MtF) and one female-to-male (FtM). Case 1 was a 35-year MtF person who had a 14-year-course of bulimia nervosa that developed after GRS. Case 2 was a 35-year FtM person with anorexia nervosa who underwent GCS 9 years before. Conclusions: We found that the treatment of our transsexual patients influenced the course of their eating disorders for a long period, which could be attributable partly to the cultural situation in Japan, an East Asian country. It is possible that many gender identity problems and identity problems in general persist even after surgery and treatment; therefore, continual clinical support should be provided for patients with gender dysphoria and eating disorders even after hormonal therapy or GRS/GCS. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.40718562874251496
Characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity in intractable unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy patients with impaired executive control function,2017,33,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041037329&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00609&partnerID=40&md5=44c3ea6a9ad38757fbf0060bff7be8e6,"Executive control function (ECF) deficit is a common complication of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Characteristics of brain network connectivity in TLE with ECF dysfunction are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate resting-state functional connectivity (FC) changes in patients with unilateral intractable TLE with impaired ECF. Forty right-handed patients with left TLE confirmed by comprehensive preoperative evaluation and postoperative pathological findings were enrolled. The patients were divided into normal ECF (G1) and decreased ECF (G2) groups according to whether they showed ECF impairment on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Twenty-three healthy volunteers were recruited as the healthy control (HC) group. All subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Group-information-guided independent component analysis (GIG-ICA) was performed to estimate resting-state networks (RSNs) for all subjects. General linear model (GLM) was employed to analyze intra-network FC (p < 0.05, false discovery rate, FDR correction) and inter-network FC (p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction) of RSN among three groups. Pearson correlations between FC and neuropsychological tests were also determined through partial correlation analysis (p < 0.05). Eleven meaningful RSNs were identified from 40 left TLE and 23 HC subjects. Comparison of intra-network FC of all 11 meaningful RSNs did not reveal significant difference among the three groups (p > 0.05, FDR correction). For inter-network analysis, G2 exhibited decreased FC between the executive control network (ECN) and default-mode network (DMN) when compared with G1 (p = 0.000, Bonferroni correction) and HC (p = 0.000, Bonferroni correction). G1 showed no significant difference of FC between ECN and DMN when compared with HC. Furthermore, FC between ECN and DMN had significant negative correlation with perseverative responses (RP), response errors (RE) and perseverative errors (RPE) and had significant positive correlation categories completed (CC) in both G1 and G2 (p < 0.05). No significant difference of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was found between G1 and G2, while intelligence quotient (IQ) testing showed significant difference between G1and G2.There was no correlation between FC and either MoCA or IQ performance. Our findings suggest that ECF impairment in unilateral TLE is not confined to the diseased temporal lobe. Decreased FC between DMN and ECN may be an important characteristic of RSN in intractable unilateral TLE. © 2017 Zhang, Yang, Qin, Liu, Qi, Chen and Li.",0.39106145251396646

The GFP represents the shared variance among lower-level personality traits and is assumed to reflect social effectiveness. We compare two contrasting hypotheses regarding the associations between the GFP and moral values. The social effectiveness view suggests relative independence of the two constructs, whereas, based on Life History theory, relevant associations would be expected. Two samples of Japanese adults participated in this study online. The first sample (Sample 1) consisted of 500 Japanese (M = 45.42 years; SD = 8.53; range 20–60; 250 women), and the second sample (Sample 2) of 487 Japanese (M = 41.13 years; SD = 10.08; range 20–60; 244 women). The GFP was found in the HEXACO-60 in Sample 1 and was extracted from the NEO-FFI in Sample 2. Correlational and multiple regression analyses revealed that the GFP was modestly, yet significantly associated with Ingroup/Loyalty which refers to individual differences in trueness, patriotism, and self-abnegations for one's group members. The GFP was not substantially associated with the other moral foundations. These findings indicate the relative independence of the GFP from moral values, which is more congruent to the social effectiveness view. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.44021739130434784

However, it remains unclear what language form and topic men use to covertly signal mate quality. In this study 69 men created compliments to impress unfamiliar women they chose to either date or work with and provided hand scans to compute 2D4D ratio as a proxy for prenatal testosterone exposure and masculinity indicator. Compliments were coded in terms of form (literal vs. metaphorical) and topic (women's appearance vs. non-appearance), with metaphorical ones being subsequently rated by 114 women for psycholinguistic features, indices of intelligence and willingness to have a romantic relationship with the author. Results showed that in a dating context, men produced more metaphorical form compliments targeting appearance compared to the working context and they were associated with men's art creativity and negatively with 2D4D ratio (i.e., positively with masculinity). Women preferred establishing a romantic relationship with a higher proportion of the men producing metaphorical compliments in a dating than a working context. Furthermore, in the dating but not the working context, women perceived men producing such compliments as being more intelligent, and importantly this correlated with the men's actual verbal intelligence. Overall, findings suggest that men may use metaphorical language compliments targeting women's appearance in a dating context to signal covertly their mate quality. © 2017 Gao, Yang, Ma, Becker, Li, Zhou and Kendrick.",0.45495495495495497
Microsatellite polymorphisms adjacent to the oxytocin receptor gene in domestic cats: Association with personality?,2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038262512&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02165&partnerID=40&md5=24a26a2f35ce1726f22e5b1f066ee3be,"A growing number of studies have explored the oxytocin system in humans and non-human animals, and some have found important genetic polymorphisms in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) associated with the bonding system, social behaviors, and personality in several species. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms in OXTR have been well-examined in various species, microsatellites (or short tandem repeats) adjacent to OXTR have rarely been studied, despite some suggestions that microsatellite polymorphisms near genes might play a role in genetic transcription and translation. In this study, we surveyed microsatellites in the upstream, intron, and downstream regions of OXTR in domestic cats (Felis catus). We succeeded in amplifying 5 out of 10 regions, and recognized these five regions as polymorphic. We compared allele frequencies in these five regions between mongrel cats in Japan (n = 100) and cats of 10 pure breeds (n = 40). There were significant differences in allele frequencies between the two populations in all microsatellite regions. Additionally, the owners of mongrel cats answered a comprehensive personality questionnaire, and factor analysis extracted four factors (Openness, Friendliness, Roughness, and Neuroticism). We examined the association between the microsatellite genotypes, age, sex, neutering status, and personality scores. Compared to their counterparts, younger cats tended to score higher on Openness, male cats scored higher on Friendliness, and female and neutered cats scored higher on Roughness. When we divided the sample into three groups depending on the length of alleles, we found a marginally significant association between Friendliness and MS3. Additionally, we found a sex-mediated effect of genotypes in MS4 on Friendliness, resulting in different effects on females and males. Our findings that mongrel cats had longer alleles in MS3 and MS4 than purebred cats, and that those cats tended to score higher on Friendliness, supported the previous findings. However, future studies such as comparison between purebred cats with apparently different origin or personality are required to determine the association of genetic variants in the OXTR with personality. © 2017 Arahori, Chijiiwa, Takagi, Bucher, Abe, Inoue-Murayama and Fujita.",0.404320987654321

However, whether and how OT modulates self-oriented processes and the underlying brain activity remains unclear. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled between-subjects design, we manipulated memory encoding and retrieval of trait adjectives related to the self, a friend and a celebrity in a self-referential task in male adults. Experiment 1 (N=51) found that OT vs placebo treatments reduced response times during encoding self-related trait adjectives but increased recognition scores of self-related information during memory retrieval. Experiment 2 (N=50) showed similar OT effects on response times during encoding self-related trait adjectives. Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results revealed that OT vs placebo treatments decreased the activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) involved in encoding of self-related trait adjectives and weakened the coupling between the MPFC activity and a cultural trait (i.e. interdependence). Experiment 3 (N=52) revealed that OT vs placebo treatments increased the right superior frontal activity during memory retrieval of selfrelated information. The results provide behavioral and fMRI evidence for OT effects on self-referential processing and suggest distinct patterns of OT modulations of brain activities engaged in encoding and retrieval of self-related information. © The Author (2017).

Besides this factor, context constraint and L2 proficiency level have also been found to affect contextual word learning (Pulido, 2003; Tekmen and Daloglu, 2006; Elgort et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015). In the present study, we adopted the event-related potential (ERP) technique and chose high constraint sentences as reading materials to further explore the effects of quantity of exposure and proficiency on L2 contextual word learning. Participants were Chinese learners of English with different English proficiency levels. For each novel word, there were four high constraint sentences with the critical word at the end of the sentence. Learners read sentences and made semantic relatedness judgment afterwards, with ERPs recorded. Results showed that in the high constraint condition where each pseudoword was embedded in four sentences with consistent meaning, N400 amplitude upon this pseudoword decreased significantly as learners read the first two sentences. High proficiency learners responded faster in the semantic relatedness judgment task. These results suggest that in high quality sentence contexts, L2 learners could rapidly acquire word meaning without multiple exposures, and L2 proficiency facilitated this learning process. © 2017 Chen, Ma, Liang and Liu.",0.40384615384615385

However, the effect of GTS is contingent on the electrode polarity in the proximity of the tongue. If an anodal electrode is attached in the proximity of the tongue, an electrical or metallic taste is elicited. On the other hand, if only cathodal electrode is attached in the proximity of the tongue, the salty taste, which is induced by electrolyte materials, is inhibited. The mechanism of this taste inhibition is not adequately understood. In this study, we aim to demonstrate that the inhibition is cause by ions, which elicit taste and which migrate from the taste sensors on the tongue by GTS. We verified the inhibitory effect of GTS on all five basic tastes induced by electrolyte materials. This technology is effective for virtual reality systems and interfaces to support dietary restrictions. Our findings demonstrate that cathodal-GTS inhibits all the five basic tastes. The results also support our hypothesis that the effects of cathodal-GTS are caused by migrating tasting ions in the mouth. © 2017 Aoyama, Sakurai, Sakurai, Mizukami, Maeda and Ando.",0.3954802259887006
Model-based analysis of thinking in problem posing as sentence integration focused on violation of the constraints,2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050658451&doi=10.1186%2fs41039-017-0057-5&partnerID=40&md5=dc2f782ceb6b0786c57cc6a34bda1b77,"The advancement of computer and communication technologies has enabled researchers to conduct and analyze the learning process of posing problems. This study investigates what learners think while posing problems as sentence integration in terms of intermediate products as well as the posed problems as the resultant product. Problem posing as sentence integration defines the arithmetic word problem structure, and posing a problem is a task to satisfy all the constraints and requirements to build a valid structure. A previous study shows that, in problem posing as sentence integration for arithmetic word problems, learners try to satisfy a relatively large number of constraints in the posed problems. In contrast, this study focuses on the violation of constraints in the intermediate products while posing problems. The result shows that learners were inclined to avoid as many violated constraints as possible throughout the problem-posing process. Although learners tend to avoid the violated constraints, naturally, they cannot avoid some mistakes. Further analysis shows that learners actually have difficulty in fulfilling particular constraints while posing the problems. Based on this analysis, it is possible to detect the difficulty of learners’ actions from the model perspective. Hence, it is possible to give accurate feedback and appropriately support the learners. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.5073170731707317
Objects mental rotation under 7 days simulated weightlessness condition: An ERP study,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040965521&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00553&partnerID=40&md5=b97639b85886bf119903dc6bcdaf3b0c,"During the spaceflight under weightlessness condition, human’s brain function may be affected by the changes of physiological effects along with the distribution of blood and body fluids to the head. This variation of brain function will influence the performance of astronauts and therefore create possible harm to flight safety. This study employs 20 male subjects in a 7-day-6° head-down tilted (HDT) bed rest model to simulate physiological effects under weightlessness condition, and use behavioral, electrophysiological techniques to compare the changes of mental rotation ability (MR ability) before and after short-term simulated weightlessness state. Behavioral results suggested that significant linear relationship existed between the rotation angle of stimuli and the reaction time, which means mental rotation process do happen during the MR task in simulated weightlessness state. In the first 3 days, the P300 component induced by object mental rotation followed the “down-up-down” pattern. In the following 4 days it changed randomly. On HDT D2, the mean of the amplitude of the P300 was the lowest, while increased gently on HDT D3. There was no obvious changing pattern of the amplitude of P300 observed after 3 days of HDT. Simulated weightlessness doesn’t change the basic process of mental rotation. The effect of simulated weightlessness is neural mechanism of self-adaptation. MR ability didn’t bounce back to the original level after HDT test. © 2017 Wang, Duan, Liao, Wang, Li and Liu.",0.4304932735426009
Perceptual-semantic congruency facilitates semantic discrimination of thermal qualities,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037089400&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02113&partnerID=40&md5=fe42ca1134898dba31e80d08dbc5c361,"The ability to sense temperature is vital to our life. It signals the environmental condition, reflects the physiological conditions of our own body, and generates feelings of pleasantness or unpleasantness. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated implicit associations between physical temperature and social/emotional concepts, suggesting the processing of temperature may even influence cognition. In this work, we examined the effect of physical warmth and coldness on semantic cognition. Participants performed speeded target categorization for thermal descriptors in the form of semantic words or illustrative figures representing the thermal qualities ""warm"" or ""cold"" while physical thermal stimulation was presented. We compared the average reaction time (RT) for the congruent and incongruent conditions managed by response key assignments. In the congruent condition, the response key for the symbol associated with warmth (coldness) was assigned to the hand with warm (cold) thermal stimulation, and in the incongruent condition the key assignment was reversed. Our results demonstrate that the average RT in the congruent condition was faster than in the incongruent one for both forms of thermal descriptors, suggesting that the experience of physical temperature facilitates the internal processing of the meaning of thermal quality. © 2017 Zhou, Ho and Watanabe.",0.4484536082474227
"Efficacy and safety of AAV2 gene therapy in children with aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency: an open-label, phase 1/2 trial",2017,96,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034257020&doi=10.1016%2fS2352-4642%2817%2930125-6&partnerID=40&md5=5ecffd23591b0786773d8d777760cd57,"Background Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is an inherited disease that causes depletion of neurotransmitters and severe motor dysfunction in infants and children. We previously reported compassionate use of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector containing the human AADC gene (AAV2-hAADC) in four children with AADC deficiency (aged 4–6 years). In this study, we aimed to establish the efficacy and safety of this treatment. Methods We did an open-label, phase 1/2 trial at the National Taiwan University Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan). We included patients who had a definitive diagnosis and clinical symptoms of AADC deficiency (hypotonia, dystonia, and oculogyric crisis), who were older than 24 months or had skull bones suitable for stereotactic surgery, and who had an anti-AAV2 antibody titre lower than 1·0 optical density. All patients received bilateral intraputaminal injections of AAV2-hAADC (1·81 × 1011 vg in total) through stereotactic brain surgery. Primary efficacy outcomes were an increase in the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (second edition; PDMS-2) score of greater than 10 points and an increase in homovanillic acid (HVA) or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid 12 months after gene therapy. We assessed patients at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after gene therapy, and every 6 months thereafter for one further year; all patients who received the treatment were included in the analysis. We assessed for surgical complications (cerebrospinal fluid leakage and intracerebral haemorrhage) at days 3–7 after AAV2 gene therapy, and we assessed adverse events during the follow-up evaluations for 12 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01395641. Findings Ten patients (median age 2·71 years, IQR 2·46–6·35) were enrolled from Oct 1, 2014, to Dec 2, 2015. All patients tolerated the surgeries and vector injections. One patient died from influenza B encephalitis during an endemic outbreak 10 months after treatment; therefore, 9 months of data were included in the analyses for this patient. All patients met the primary efficacy endpoint: 12 months after gene therapy, PDMS-2 scores were increased by a median of 62 points (IQR 39–93; p=0·005) and HVA concentrations by a median of 25 nmol/L (IQR 11–48; p=0·012); however, there was no significant change in 5-HIAA concentrations (median difference 0, IQR 0–5; p=0·20). In total, 101 adverse events were reported, with the most common being pyrexia (16 [16%] of 101 events) and orofacial dyskinesia (ten [10%]). 12 serious adverse events occurred in six patients, including one death (treatment-unrelated encephalitis due to influenza B infection), one life-threatening pyrexia, and ten events that led to hospital admission. Transient post-gene therapy dyskinesia occurred in all patients but was resolved with risperidone. Of 31 treatment-related adverse events, only one (patient 1) was severe in intensity, and none led to hospital admission or death. Interpretation Our findings suggest that intraputaminal injection of AAV2-hAADC is well tolerated and might improve motor development in children with AADC deficiency.

The interplay between topic shift and focus in the dynamic construction of discourse representations,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037142842&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02184&partnerID=40&md5=c52a49de50a5e51e9e7d34942ec93a24,"Previous studies have suggested that focusing an element can enhance the activation of the focused element and bring about a number of processing benefits. However, whether and how this local prominence of information interacts with global discourse organization remains unclear. In the present study, we addressed this issue in two experiments. Readers were presented with four-sentence discourses. The first sentence of each discourse contained a critical word that was either focused or unfocused in relation to a wh-question preceding the discourse. The second sentence either maintained or shifted the topic of the first sentence. Participants were told to read for comprehension and for a probe recognition task in which the memory of the critical words was tested. In Experiment 1, when the probe words were tested immediately after the point of topic shift, we found shorter response times for the focused critical words than the unfocused ones regardless of topic manipulation. However, in Experiment 2, when the probe words were tested two sentences away from the point of topic shift, we found the facilitation effect of focus only in the topic-maintained discourses, but not in the topic-shifted discourses. This suggests that the facilitation effect of focus was not immediately suppressed at the point of topic shifting, but when additional information was added to the new topic. Our findings provide evidence for the dynamic interplay between global topic structure and local salience of information and have important implications on how activation of information fluctuates in mental representation.",0.4385245901639344

In a cultural setting where family relationships are highly valued and contribute critically to well-being, such self-isolation can thwart HIV self-management and engagement in medical care, and so heighten risk for health disparities. To understand this phenomenon, we conducted individual in-depth interviews with 34 persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLwHA) in Shanghai and Beijing. Inductive content analysis revealed a range of forms of self-isolation motivation, beliefs, and behaviors influenced by: 1) internalized stigma and desire to avoid discrimination; 2) HIV-related factors such as HIV knowledge and disease progression; and 3) familial factors such as a sense of responsibility and family members’ reactions. Based on a proposed framework centering on dialectical family influences (whereby PLwHA are pushed away from, yet pulled toward the family fold), implications for provision of multidisciplinary care in medical settings are considered, including culturally appropriate strategies to decrease health disparities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",0.42857142857142855
Hyper-realistic face masks: a new challenge in person identification,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072231199&doi=10.1186%2fs41235-017-0079-y&partnerID=40&md5=3da3b2dfd2be66a224833ad951116744,"We often identify people using face images. This is true in occupational settings such as passport control as well as in everyday social environments. Mapping between images and identities assumes that facial appearance is stable within certain bounds. For example, a person’s apparent age, gender and ethnicity change slowly, if at all. It also assumes that deliberate changes beyond these bounds (i.e., disguises) would be easy to spot. Hyper-realistic face masks overturn these assumptions by allowing the wearer to look like an entirely different person. If unnoticed, these masks break the link between facial appearance and personal identity, with clear implications for applied face recognition. However, to date, no one has assessed the realism of these masks, or specified conditions under which they may be accepted as real faces. Herein, we examined incidental detection of unexpected but attended hyper-realistic masks in both photographic and live presentations. Experiment 1 (UK; n = 60) revealed no evidence for overt detection of hyper-realistic masks among real face photos, and little evidence of covert detection. Experiment 2 (Japan; n = 60) extended these findings to different masks, mask-wearers and participant pools. In Experiment 3 (UK and Japan; n = 407), passers-by failed to notice that a live confederate was wearing a hyper-realistic mask and showed limited evidence of covert detection, even at close viewing distance (5 vs. 20 m). Across all of these studies, viewers accepted hyper-realistic masks as real faces. Specific countermeasures will be required if detection rates are to be improved. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.5208333333333334

The aims of this study were to explore both the role families play in gambling initiation, maintenance, and help-seeking, and the harm caused to families by the gambling behavior using a qualitative approach. Methods: Regular older adult gamblers were included in the study. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 older adults to gain an understanding of gambling from their perspective. Older adult gamblers described their lived experience of gambling ranging from initiation to harm and attempts to cut down or limit gambling. Data were analyzed using thematic network analysis. Results: The mean age of the 25 participants was 66.2 years. The majority were male (n = 18), of Chinese ethnicity (n = 16), had secondary education (n = 9), were married (n = 20), and currently employed (n = 15). Four organizing themes related to the role of families in initiation and maintenance of gambling, harm caused to family members, and their role in help-seeking were identified. Discussion and conclusions: The study emphasizes the role of Asian families in both initiation and maintenance of gambling. Hence, families must be involved in prevention and outreach programs. Family members must be educated, so that they can encourage help-seeking to ensure early treatment and recovery. There is a need for interventional studies for reducing stress and improving coping among family members. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.4723404255319149

The paper, by adopting an inductive analytical approach, draws key insights from the literature on microfoundations and sustainability and evidence from representatives of 5 Cultural and Creative Industry SMEs in Italy and of 5 in the United Kingdom. The findings suggest that owner-managers play a crucial role when engaging in sustainability activities jointly with employees and other stakeholders, through which individual-level actions enhance collective organizational-level sustainability practices. The U.K. and Italian cases highlight 2 contrasting approaches to dealing with sustainability; thus, the paper contributes to the emerging literature on SME microfoundations and sustainability.

Participants were 178 young students (55 men) who completed the TTF scale and underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between the regional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and TTF scores corrected for age and sex. Results showed that the ALFF value in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), precuneus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) were negatively associated with TTF scores. These findings suggest that the spontaneous brain activity of brain regions like the dmPFC, precuneus and IPL which are implicated in mentalizing and empathic response are associated with individual differences in the TTF. © 2017 Li and Lu.",0.43352601156069365

This study investigated how EBPM performance is affected by task duration by having university students (n = 223) perform an EBPM task that was embedded within an ongoing computer-based color-matching task. For this experiment, we separated the overall task's duration into the filler task duration and the ongoing task duration. The filler task duration is the length of time between the intention and the beginning of the ongoing task, and the ongoing task duration is the length of time between the beginning of the ongoing task and the appearance of the first Prospective Memory (PM) cue. The filler task duration and ongoing task duration were further divided into three levels: 3, 6, and 9 min. Two factors were then orthogonally manipulated between-subjects using a multinomial processing tree model to separate the effects of different task durations on the two EBPM components. A mediation model was then created to verify whether task duration influences EBPM via self-reminding or discrimination. The results reveal three points. (1) Lengthening the duration of ongoing tasks had a negative effect on EBPM performance while lengthening the duration of the filler task had no significant effect on it. (2) As the filler task was lengthened, both the prospective and retrospective components show a decreasing and then increasing trend. Also, when the ongoing task duration was lengthened, the prospective component decreased while the retrospective component significantly increased. (3) The mediating effect of discrimination between the task duration and EBPM performance was significant. We concluded that different task durations influence EBPM performance through different components with discrimination being the mediator between task duration and EBPM performance. © 2017 Zhang, Tang and Liu.",0.4697508896797153

In Experiment 1, the participants (N = 30) evaluated 24 musical excerpts in five dimensions (pleasure, arousal, dominance, emotional tension, and liking). In Experiment 2, the participants (N = 40) evaluated 48 musical excerpts. Perceptions of the musical excerpts differed significantly according to mode, even if the stimuli were Western musical excerpts. The major-mode music induced greater pleasure and arousal and produced higher liking ratings than the minor-mode music, whereas the minor-mode music induced greater tension than the major-mode music. Mode did not influence the dominance rating. Perception of Western music was not influenced by harmonic complexity. Moreover, preference for musical mode was influenced by previous exposure to Western music. These results confirm the cross-cultural emotion induction effects of musical modes in Western music. © 2017 Fang, Shang and Chen.",0.47593582887700536

Two studies were conducted to measure the implicit subjective temporal trajectory (STT) of Chinese undergraduates. Study 1 used a Go/No-go association task to measure participants' implicit attitudes toward their past, present, and future selves. The obtained implicit STT was different from the explicit pattern found in former research. It showed that the future self was viewed to be identical to the present self and participants implicitly evaluated their present self as better than the past self. Since this comparison of the past and present selves suggested a cultural difference, we aimed to replicate this finding in Study 2. Using an implicit association test, we again found that the present self was more easily associated with positive valence than the past self. Overall, both studies reveal an implicitly inclining-flat STT (i.e., past<present = future) for Chinese undergraduates. Implications of this difference in explicit-implicit measures and the cultural differences of temporal self appraisals are discussed. © 2017 Yang, Zhao, Guan and Huang.",0.441340782122905

Drawing on qualitative interview data as well as ethnographic observations, a realist approach was applied in this study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptance, preliminary outcomes and potential sustainability of a community-based intervention to provide care and support to LBC, in a migrant-sending area of rural China. The intervention program comprised “Children's Clubs” in local communities, in which LBC participate in play and educational activities under the care and supervision of local volunteers. Twelve Clubs in 12 different villages were evaluated for the study. In each village, semi-structured interviews were conducted with three community stakeholders, and children and primary caregivers from two families, to examine their perceptions and experiences with regard to the intervention. Our findings indicated that most Clubs adapted the initial program theory and implementation plan to specific community contexts, particularly the socio-economic situation and the support from village leadership and other community members. Program implementation mechanisms consisted of integrating available resources, engaging local volunteers, and delivering various Club activities. Preliminary outcomes indicated the success in establishing a community care platform to benefit the emotional and behavioral wellbeing of LBC, and to enhance the community support networks. To ensure program sustainability, the Children's Clubs should explore new funding schemes, expand the pool of qualified volunteers, and improve the curricular and activities at the Clubs. © 2017 The Authors",0.5344129554655871

However, existing studies have focused exclusively on regulating negative emotion but not positive emotion. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the influence of emotion regulation strategies for positive emotion on memory. One hundred and twenty college students were selected as participants. Emotional pictures (positive, negative and neutral) were selected from Chinese Affective Picture System (CAPS) as experimental materials. We employed a mixed, 4 (emotion regulation strategies: cognitive up-regulation, cognitive down-regulation, expressive suppression, passive viewing) × 3 (emotional pictures: positive, neutral, negative) experimental design. We investigated the influences of different emotion regulation strategies on memory performance, using free recall and recognition tasks with pictures varying in emotional content. The results showed that recognition and free recall memory performance of the cognitive reappraisal groups (up-regulation and down-regulation) were both better than that of the passive viewing group for all emotional pictures. No significant differences were reported in the two kinds of memory scores between the expressive suppression and passive viewing groups. The results also showed that the memory performance with the emotional pictures differed according to the form of memory test. For the recognition test, participants performed better with positive images than with neutral images. Free recall scores with negative images were higher than those with neutral images. These results suggest that both cognitive reappraisal regulation strategies (up-regulation and down-regulation) promoted explicit memories of the emotional content of stimuli, and the form of memory test influenced performance with emotional pictures. © 2017 Wang, Chen and Han.",0.5
Decomposing a chunk into its elements and reorganizing them as a new chunk: The two different sub-processes underlying insightful chunk decomposition,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033780244&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02001&partnerID=40&md5=882b438768a8e727fae407070fd577ff,"Familiar chunks can be processed highly efficiently, and this automatic process can prohibit the problem solver from developing novel and original ways to creatively solve difficult problems. For this reason, the role of the reverse process, chunk decomposition (CD), the process by which familiar patterns are broken down into their component elements in order to be regrouped in another meaningful manner, has been generally recognized as part of the creative process. However, previous studies on this issue have mainly focused on the decomposition process of CD (the D-process), while the reorganization process of CD has been greatly neglected or has not been distinctively identified in previous work. In this paper, we argue that the R-process could be equally as important as the D-process for CD. Even if a problem solver manages to decompose a familiar chunk into its elements, he or she still may not solve the problem if these elements are not successfully organized in a new and meaningful manner. To investigate whether the cognitive mechanism of the R-process is different from that of the D-process, we designed an experiment for detecting the effects of chunk tightness, which is regarded as the key factor in CD and which can be experimentally manipulated by the radical-level (loose) and stroke-level (tight) Chinese character CD tasks in the D-process, the R-process, and the more purified organization task (the O-process task) that does not involve the decomposition process. Our results showed that the stroke-level (tight) task was more difficult than the radical-level (loose) task for the D-process. However, for the R-process, the stroke- and radical-level tasks showed no differences in performance. Moreover, for the more purified reorganization task, the O-process task, the radical-level organization and reorganization could be even more difficult than the stroke-level organization and reorganization. This result demonstrated that the cognitive processes underlying chunk decomposition and reorganization are fundamentally different. Therefore, more general concepts such as chunk restructuring that could include both D- and R-processes might be more suitable in accounting for this type of creative insight. © 2017 Wu, He, Zhou, Xiao and Luo.",0.36257309941520466

Therefore, we hypothesized that if IPC functions as social glue, then IPC produced by ILT also represents a social relationship. Participants were dyadic pairs with a preexisting social relationship (acquaintance, friend, or best-friend), and we assessed the closeness between the partners. Postural sway in two quiet standing conditions-no touch (NT) and ILT (a mutual light touch with < 1 N) condition-was concurrently measured with the side-by-side standing position, and the association of IPC with intradyadic closeness (rapport) was analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling. The results showed that unintentional IPC was higher in both axes of the ILT condition than in NT condition. Additionally, IPC in the mediolateral axis (the partner side) of the ILT condition was positively correlated with intradyadic closeness, whereas that in the anteroposterior axis (the non-partner side) showed a negative association. As expected, IPC represented intradyadic closeness (rapport). Results indicate that, in unintentional IPC produced by ILT, the priority of processing sensory feedback for postural control, which is received from the individual and a partner, is modulated depending on the rapport in interactional coupled feedback loops between the two individuals (i.e., good rapport increases the degree of taking in feedback from a partner). Thus, unintentional IPC produced by ILT functions as social glue, and it provides an understanding of the sociopsychological aspect in the human-to-human postural coordination mechanism. © 2017 Ishigaki, Imai and Morioka.",0.3594306049822064
Effect of electro-acupuncture and moxibustion on brain connectivity in patients with crohn’s disease: A resting-state fMRI study,2017,28,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040986773&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00559&partnerID=40&md5=2a0dd324c37af4dafe4767a8f4c9d5f1,"Acupuncture and moxibustion have been shown to be effective in treating Crohn’s disease (CD), but their therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Here we compared brain responses to either electro-acupuncture or moxibustion treatment in CD patients experiencing remission. A total of 65 patients were randomly divided into an electroacupuncture group (n = 32) or a moxibustion group (n = 33), and treated for 12 weeks. Eighteen patients in the electro-acupuncture group and 20 patients in the moxibustion group underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and after treatment. Seed-based analysis was used to compare the restingstate functional connectivity (rsFC) between bilateral hippocampus and other brain regions before and after the treatments, as well as between the two groups. The CD activity index (CDAI) and inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) were used to evaluate disease severity and patient quality of life. Electro-acupuncture and moxibustion both significantly reduced CDAI values and increased IBDQ scores. In the electro-acupuncture group, the rsFC values between bilateral hippocampus and anterior middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and insula were significantly increased, and the changes were negatively correlated with the CDAI scores. In the moxibustion group, the rsFC values between bilateral hippocampus and precuneus as well as inferior parietal lobe (IPC) were significantly elevated, and the changes were negatively correlated with the CDAI scores. We conclude that the therapeutic effects of electro-acupuncture and moxibustion on CD may involve the differently modulating brain homeostatic afferent processing network and default mode network (DMN), respectively. © 2017 Bao, Wang, Liu, Shi, Jin, Wu, Zeng, Zhang, Liu and Wu.",0.4024390243902439
"Dark Triad, perceptions of organizational politics and counterproductive work behaviors: The moderating effect of political skills",2017,57,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033436196&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01972&partnerID=40&md5=c6cb07dfa6f4b13f7722b88bef143213,"The aim of this work focuses on the relationship among the Dark Triad (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism), perceptions of organizational politics, political skills, and counterproductive work behavior. This study empirically tests the mediating role of perceptions of organizational politics in the relationship between the Dark Triad and counterproductive work behavior. Furthermore, the study investigates the moderating role of political skills in strengthening the link between the Dark Triad and the perceptions of organizational politics. A sample of 149 participants was randomly selected. To analyze the data of the present work, we employed a structural equation model using partial least square and PROCESS. From empirical findings, we imply an inference that perception of organizational politics partially mediates the Dark Triad's influence on the counterproductive work behavior. Moreover, the results identify the moderating role of political skills in strengthening the link between the Dark Triad and the perceptions of organizational politics. Empirical findings suggest important policy implications for the hospitality industry. © 2017 Baloch, Meng, Xu, Cepeda-Carrion, Danish and Bari.",0.40606060606060607
"Influence of eating quickly and eating until full on anthropometric gains in girls: A population-based, longitudinal study",2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030465123&doi=10.1111%2fcch.12482&partnerID=40&md5=b34c5b3cb0928c6304e66b3760ea57b1,"Background: In examining childhood overweight/obesity, there is a need to consider both eating quickly and eating until full. This longitudinal study investigated the influence of eating quickly and/or eating until full on anthropometric variables and becoming overweight/obese among Japanese schoolgirls. Methods: Study participants were fourth-grade schoolgirls (aged 9 or 10 years) in Ina Town, Japan. Physical examinations and a questionnaire survey were performed at baseline (fourth grade) and after 3 years (seventh grade). Height, weight, and waist circumference were measured in the physical examinations, while the data on eating quickly and eating until full were collected in the questionnaire survey. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance were used to compare the differences in each anthropometric variable between fourth and seventh grade among groups. Results: Data on 425 non-overweight/obese schoolgirls in fourth grade were analyzed. Gains in anthropometric variables (body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio) from fourth to seventh grade were significantly larger in the “eating quickly and eating until full” group than in the “not eating quickly and not eating until full” group. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the gains between the “eating quickly or eating until full” group and the “not eating quickly and not eating until full” group. The proportion of overweight/obese girls in seventh grade was higher in the “eating quickly and eating until full” group than in the other groups. Conclusions: Eating quickly and eating until full had a substantial impact on excess gains in anthropometric variables among schoolgirls, suggesting that modifying these eating behaviors may help prevent non-overweight/obese girls from the excess gains. Accordingly, school health programs need to focus on not eating quickly and/or not eating until full to prevent overweight/obesity; it is necessary to emphasize “the risk of overweight/obesity associated with these eating behaviors” in schools. © 2017 The Authors.

Promoting verbal reports and action plans by staff during monthly meetings in a Japanese residential home,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033436071&doi=10.1002%2fbin.1495&partnerID=40&md5=fa1bbfc5c446a962ed97ac8db0ce585b,"We examined factors leading to the successful implementation of behavioral programs by staff caring for children in a Japanese residential home. We used a multiple baseline design across 3 units of residential homes to assess the effects of 2 interventions. The primary dependent measures were staff verbal reports (e.g., descriptions of antecedents, behavior, and/or consequences) and action plans (instructions for intervention). Our results indicated that the use of quantitative data (e.g., frequency of behaviors) increased the percentage of time spent engaged in verbal reports, whereas the use of qualitative data (e.g., A-B-C recording) increased the percentage of action plans. In conclusion, our intervention promoted effective verbal reports and action plans. Using these tools, staff in residential housing facilities may be able to improve support delivered to children in Japanese residential programs. Future research may help to verify whether similar effects can be achieved in other settings. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0.47651006711409394
The effects of torture-related stressors on long-term complex post-traumatic symptoms in South Korean torture survivors,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84965044021&doi=10.1002%2fijop.12276&partnerID=40&md5=bea496d208d1b299d46412ca8e0d61e7,"This study explored whether perceived distress from specific stressors during and after torture explain long-term complex post-traumatic symptoms of South Korean torture survivors. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of survivors who had been tortured by the homeland regime from the 1970s to the 2000s. Data from 206 survivors were gathered by key informants using target sampling and snowballing techniques. Project staff designed scales to encompass the specific types of stressors related to torture techniques used in Korea. Frequencies and distress ratings of exposure to torture, post-torture psychosocial stressors and physical damage related to torture were gathered. Psychological symptoms were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean version and subscales of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised-Korean version. Perceived distress from torture stressors was mainly divided into factors representing physical, psychological and deprivation torture by adapting a principal axis factor analysis. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that distress from psychological torture explained post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that distress from deprivation explained PTSD and anxiety after controlling for demographic variables, psychological preparedness, time span since torture and distress from trauma other than torture. Among post-torture stressors, distress from physical damage related to torture and social exclusion were strong indicators of complex symptoms. © 2016 International Union of Psychological Science",0.5
Patterns of eye movements when observers judge female facial attractiveness,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033571750&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01909&partnerID=40&md5=823ba5c0d3e5e5c756ac14e5e1732d4f,"The purpose of the present study is to explore the fixed model for the explicit judgments of attractiveness and infer which features are important to judge the facial attractiveness. Behavioral studies on the perceptual cues for female facial attractiveness implied three potentially important features: averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphy. However, these studies did not explained which regions of facial images influence the judgments of attractiveness. Therefore, the present research recorded the eye movements of 24 male participants and 19 female participants as they rated a series of 30 photographs of female facial attractiveness. Results demonstrated the following: (1) Fixation is longer and more frequent on the noses of female faces than on their eyes and mouths (no difference exists between the eyes and the mouth); (2) The average pupil diameter at the nose region is bigger than that at the eyes and mouth (no difference exists between the eyes and the mouth); (3) the number of fixations of male participants was significantly more than female participants. (4) Observers first fixate on the eyes and mouth (no difference exists between the eyes and the mouth) before fixating on the nose area. In general, participants attend predominantly to the nose to form attractiveness judgments. The results of this study add a new dimension to the existing literature on judgment of facial attractiveness. The major contribution of the present study is the finding that the area of the nose is vital in the judgment of facial attractiveness. This finding establish a contribution of partial processing on female facial attractiveness judgments during eye-tracking. © 2017 Zhang, Wang, Wang, Zhang and Xiang.",0.5155038759689923

Corporate social responsibility and employee outcomes: A moderated mediation model of organizational identification and moral identity,2017,82,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032725536&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01906&partnerID=40&md5=f99e70dd5dd4d89f55c6a112199bf56b,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) research is not new, but its importance to today's socially conscious market environment is even more evident in recent years. This study moves beyond CSR as simply the socially responsible actions and policies of organizations and focuses on the complex psychology of CSR as it relates to individuals within the organization. Given CSR can positively affect both the individuals within the organization and the organization itself, better understanding and leveraging the mechanisms and conditions of CSR that facilitate desired employee outcomes is crucial for organizational performance. However, scholars lack consensus in determining a theoretical framework for understanding how and under what conditions CSR will make an impact on employees and ultimately organizational performance. This study adds clarity by exploring the effect of perceived CSR on a more comprehensive set of employees' attitudinal and behavioral reactions (i.e., turnover intention, in-role job performance, and helping behavior) via the mediating mechanism of organizational identification and the moderating condition of moral identity. Hypotheses were derived using social identity theory. Results were based on data obtained from 340 Chinese manufacturing employee-supervisor dyads. This study found that employees' perceived CSR had an indirect relationship via organizational identification with each of the variables: (1) turnover intention, (2) in-role job performance, and (3) helping behavior. Specifically, the negative relationship between perceived CSR and turnover intention was stronger when employees had higher moral identity and the positive relationship between perceived CSR and in-role job performance and helping behavior was amplified by moral identity. Our findings show how the mediating mechanism of organizational identity and the moderating condition of moral identity work together to improve organizational effectiveness. The findings reveal several ways in which organizations can strategically focus their CSR and human resource efforts, such as applying this model and focusing on moral identity as a key indicator when evaluating employees. © 2017 Wang, Fu, Qiu, Moore and Wang.",0.5211726384364821
Differential effects of oxytocin on visual perspective taking for men and women,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042043735&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00228&partnerID=40&md5=511dfe6445d44cd816dc138b34295f8b,"Although oxytocin (OXT) has been shown to lead to reduced self-orientation, no study to date has directly and effectively weakened the egocentric tendencies in perspective taking tasks for both men and women. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, mixed design study we investigated the effects of OXT on men and women in visual perspective taking tasks. The results showed that OXT shortened the differences in response time between men and women in all experimental conditions. In addition, after OXT administration, the difference in reaction time between judging from one’s own perspective and judging from others’ perspectives decreased in female participants; however, this effect was not present in males. This may indicate that under OXT treatment, women have a higher tendency to overcome interference from their position and mindset when judging others’ perspectives. However, OXT did not affect participants’ accuracy, which is possibility because the used task was not suited to detect performance improvements caused by OXT. In summary, the above results may indicate that OXT could increase perspective-taking abilities through reducing self-bias and increasing the perception of others; furthermore, this trend mainly affected women rather than men. © 2017 Yue, Jiang, Yue and Huang.",0.3894736842105263
The functional architecture of the brain underlies strategic deception in impression management,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034776767&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00513&partnerID=40&md5=cac2ccb92bad8d739e8b248e0a2cf87b,"Impression management, as one of the most essential skills of social function, impacts one’s survival and success in human societies. However, the neural architecture underpinning this social skill remains poorly understood. By employing a two-person bargaining game, we exposed three strategies involving distinct cognitive processes for social impression management with different levels of strategic deception. We utilized a novel adaptation of Granger causality accounting for signal-dependent noise (SDN), which captured the directional connectivity underlying the impression management during the bargaining game. We found that the sophisticated strategists engaged stronger directional connectivity from both dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and retrosplenial cortex to rostral prefrontal cortex, and the strengths of these directional influences were associated with higher level of deception during the game. Using the directional connectivity as a neural signature, we identified the strategic deception with 80%accuracy by a machine-learning classifier. These results suggest that different social strategies are supported by distinct patterns of directional connectivity among key brain regions for social cognition. © 2017 Luo, Ma, Bhatt, Montague and Feng.",0.48214285714285715

However, such theories must also explain why each route is invoked, lest one can fit any data set with enough alternatives. One possible explanation is that route selection is based on a least-cost principle: the route that requires fewer cognitive resources (including time) relative to the goal at hand. We investigated this explanation with a dual-display version of visual search, where the target could be identified via opposing (easy or hard forms of) feature and conjunction search conditions. The data support a contextualized version of the least-cost principle in that the cost of computing least-cost also influences route selection: participants assessed alternatives, but only when the cost of that assessment was relatively low. © 2017 Phillips, Takeda and Sugimoto.",0.4931506849315068
"Relationships between catastrophic thought, bodily sensations and physical symptoms",2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033381556&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0110-z&partnerID=40&md5=12bec0f575bd3ac470d8511b9941c6b5,"Background: Researchers have recently begun to seek cognitive explanations for physical symptoms with no obvious biological cause. Concepts such as somatization, somatosensory amplification, and somatosensory catastrophizing have been invoked to explain these phenomena. Somatosensory amplification occurs when these bodily sensations become stronger and more painful. Somatosensory catastrophizing is the tendency to attribute these bodily sensations to unbearable functional modulation or as signs of serious illness. This causes the sufferer to pay excessive attention to these physical sensations. However, there is no scale for evaluating somatosensory catastrophizing, and there are no standard diagnostic criteria. There were two objectives for this study: to develop a scale for evaluating somatosensory catastrophizing and to investigate relationships between somatosensory amplification, somatosensory catastrophizing, and physical symptoms. Methods: In the first part of this study, in which we developed the scale, there were 231 student participants with an average age of 20.1 years. Of these, 57% of the participants were female. In the second part of the study, there were two groups of participants. The first group consisted of 158 non-patient subjects, 56% of whom were female, with an average age of 20.2 years. There were 33 outpatients receiving treatment for somatoform disorders in the second group. The average age of these participants, of whom 67% were female, was 48.8 years. The second part of the study was conducted using standardized self-rating questionnaires to assess somatosensory amplification and catastrophizing. Results: We developed a 27-item scale, which we have called the Somatosensory catastrophizing scale (SSCS). The SSCS assesses five key areas, and our analysis confirmed it to be valid and highly reliable. The scale identified that the patient group from the second part of the study scored more highly than the control group for both somatosensory amplification and catastrophizing. Additionally, the results of covariance structure analyses revealed a significant causal relationship of the form ""somatosensory amplifcation"" via ""somatosensory catastrophizing"" to ""physical symptoms"". This relationship held in both groups of participants. The key difference between the patient and non-patient groups was that somatosensory catastrophizing had a greater impact on the physical symptoms of the participants in the patient group. Conclusions: In this study, we developed the SSCS, which enables us to measure somatosensory catastrophizing empirically. We then clarified the relationship between somatosensory amplification, somatosensory catastrophizing, and physical symptoms. In the future, we expect to be able to apply our new understanding to developing intervention techniques to mitigate the physical symptoms caused by somatosensory catastrophizing. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.40954773869346733

Although some studies have shown better color constancy for 3-D conditions, the role of specific cues remains unclear. In this study, we compared color constancy for a 3-D miniature room (a real scene consisting of actual objects) and 2-D still images of that room presented on a monitor using three viewing methods: binocular viewing, monocular viewing, and head movement. We found that color constancy was better for the 3-D room; however, color constancy for the 2-D image improved when the viewing method caused the scene to be perceived more like a 3-D scene. Separate measurements of the perceptual 3-D effect of each viewing method also supported these results. An additional experiment comparing a miniature room and its image with and without texture suggested that surface texture of scene objects contributes to color constancy. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.5732484076433121
Qigong/tai chi for sleep and fatigue in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy: a randomized controlled trial,2017,54,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033383179&doi=10.1002%2fpon.4256&partnerID=40&md5=8ef582abb7babe36a8cfe3d4024e0ca6,"Objectives: Sleep disturbances and fatigue are common in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Prior research suggests mind-body techniques may improve these outcomes. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of qigong/tai chi (QGTC) in men with prostate cancer undergoing radiotherapy. Methods: Men with prostate cancer starting definitive radiation were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) QGTC; (2) light exercise (LE); or (3) waiting list control. Sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory) were assessed at baseline, midway through radiotherapy (T2), during the last week of radiotherapy (T3), and at 1 (T4) and 3 months (T5) after the end of radiotherapy. Patients in the QGTC and LE groups attended three 40-minute classes per week throughout radiotherapy. Results: Ninety patients were randomized to the 3 groups (QGTC = 26; LE = 26; waiting list control = 24). The QGTC group reported longer sleep duration midway through radiotherapy (QGTC = 7.01 h; LE = 6.42; WL = 6.50; P =.05), but this difference did not persist over time. There were no group differences in other domains of sleep or fatigue. Exploratory analyses conducted to examine the effect of health-related quality of life (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and American Urological Association Symptom score) on sleep and fatigue showed significant correlations across multiple domains. Conclusions: Qigong/tai chi during radiation for prostate cancer resulted in superior sleep duration midway through radiation, but this effect was not durable, and there were no differences in other domains of sleep or fatigue. Exploratory analysis demonstrated that both sleep and fatigue were highly correlated with prostate cancer–related physical symptoms. Future mind-body intervention studies should incorporate multimodal therapy focused on improving physical symptoms in this population. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0.4015151515151515
Developing control over the execution of scripts: The role of maintained hierarchical goal representations,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025455619&doi=10.1016%2fj.jecp.2017.06.008&partnerID=40&md5=8d129d2345ebde69e31a61ae6da639aa,"The execution of a script often requires detecting and resolving conflict with a goal, particularly in nonroutine situations. To take the example of taking a bus daily to work, if someone's usual bus is delayed and a bus for another destination comes first, the person must inhibit taking it and wait for the usual one. Young children can gradually acquire the ability to control the execution of scripts in such nonroutine situations, but few studies have explored the control process involved. In two experiments, we investigated the role of developments in the maintenance of hierarchical goal representations and in executive functions. We measured the ability to control the execution of scripts using a task in which children helped a doll select items to wear; clothing options were presented in an unexpected order in the nonroutine situations. The younger children (4-year-olds) could not flexibly control their execution of scripts in nonroutine situations, although they could exogenously detect and resolve conflict if they were prompted to maintain a subgoal. The older children (5-year-olds) endogenously controlled script execution based on a main goal, whereas subgoal maintenance led them to rigidly control their performance. In addition, children's inhibition abilities were associated with their control of script execution. These findings indicate that the development of the control process underlying the execution of scripts in nonroutine situations is partially dependent on the ability to maintain hierarchical goal representations. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.44871794871794873
Deficits in go/no-go task performance in male undergraduate high-risk alcohol users are driven by speeded responding to go stimuli,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013055769&doi=10.1080%2f00952990.2017.1282502&partnerID=40&md5=98dc5e3fc398584f3f41103cb9f835ea,"Background: Response disinhibition plays an important role in addictive behaviors. However, results of studies on the performance on response inhibition tasks of individuals evidencing potentially problematic levels of alcohol drinking are mixed. Objectives: We assessed conditions under which persons with a relatively high risk of alcohol dependence show inhibition deficits in such tasks and investigated the nature of those deficits. Methods: Fifty-eight male undergraduate students, 27 of which were high-risk drinkers according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, performed a go/no-go inhibition task with differing percentages of no-go trials (50% vs. 25%), stimulus presentation times (600 vs. 200 ms), and types of go and no-go stimuli (alcohol related vs. -unrelated). Response inhibition was indexed by response time (RT) to go trials and response accuracy on go and no-go trials. Results: There were no differences between low- and high-risk drinkers on any of the three outcome measures under the 600-ms stimulus presentation condition. Under the 200-ms condition, the high-risk drinkers showed faster RTs to go stimuli, and more errors on both go- and no-go trials than the low-risk drinkers, irrespective of type and percentage of no-go stimuli. However, the accuracy differences between the two groups disappeared after controlling for the RT on go trials, suggesting a speed-accuracy trade-off. Conclusion: High-risk drinkers’ response inhibition deficits are not restricted to alcohol-related cues and are especially likely to occur under conditions prompting fast responding. These findings could be used to inform treatment, suggesting the promotion of strategies aimed at preventing high-risk alcohol users from making quick decisions. © 2017 the Author(s).

However, these studies lack elaboration on mechanisms and do not rule out the effect of employees' proactive personality during empirical testing. We investigate empowering leadership from individual perspective due to the variation of empowerment levels even in the same team. Our research proposes a more elaborated theoretical model that explains why, and when, empowering leadership might promote employee proactive behavior. Specifically, we examine mediating mechanisms based on social cognitive theory and propose trust in leader competency as boundary condition. Using a sample of 280 leader-follower dyads from a large state-owned Chinese company, our results revealed that (1) empowering leadership was positively related to proactive behavior, with role breadth self-efficacy acting as a mediator for this relationship; (2) employees' trust in leader competency moderated both the empowering leadership-subordinate proactive behavior relationship and the mediating effect of role breadth self-efficacy, such that the empowering leadership-subordinate proactive behavior relationship was weaker, and the mediating effect of role breadth self-efficacy was stronger, for employees with high levels of trust in leader competency. © 2017 Yin, Xing, Li and Guo.",0.39215686274509803
Judging Personality from a Brief Sample of Behaviour: Detecting where Others Stand on Trait Continua,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028403820&doi=10.1002%2fper.2116&partnerID=40&md5=895db80048c3f302983bebccb56b6bd9,"Trait inferences occur routinely and rapidly during social interaction, sometimes based on scant or fleeting information. In this research, participants (perceivers) made inferences of targets' big-five traits after briefly watching or listening to an unfamiliar target (a third party) performing various mundane activities (telling a scripted joke or answering questions about him/herself or reading aloud a paragraph of promotional material). Across three studies, when perceivers judged targets to be either low or high in one or more dimensions of the big-five traits, they tended to be correct, but they did not tend to be correct when they judged targets as average. Such inferences seemed to vary in effectiveness across different trait dimensions and depending on whether the target's behaviour was presented either in a video with audio, a silent video, or just in an audio track—perceivers generally were less often correct when they judged targets as average in each of the big-five traits across various information channels (videos with audio, silent videos, and audios). Study 3 replicated these findings in a different culture. We conclude with discussion of the scope and the adaptive value of this trait inferential ability.

Adverse orienting effects on visual working memory encoding and maintenance,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84997606039&doi=10.3758%2fs13423-016-1205-4&partnerID=40&md5=bf14bf44c8d108652c78231f86048aa7,"Visual working memory (VWM) representations can be strengthened by pre-cues presented before, and retro-cues presented after, the memory display, providing evidence that attentional orienting plays a role in memory encoding and maintenance. It is unknown whether attentional orienting to VWM stimuli can also have adverse effects (known as inhibition of return; IOR), as has been found for perceptual-cueing tasks. If so, this would provide further evidence for common attentional orienting mechanisms for mnemonic and perceptual representations. In Experiment 1, we used pre-cueing and demonstrated an increased encoding probability, but not precision, at short SOAs, but probability decreased at long SOAs, reminiscent of the classic IOR findings. In Experiment 2, we used retro-cueing and showed that it improved memory performance, unless attention was cued back to the center of the display by a second cue. In this case, the deleterious effects were on precision, indicating that the item was still retained, but its quality of representation suffered. Together, these results provide further evidence for universal spatial attentional mechanisms operating on perceptual as well as mnemonic representations. © 2016, The Author(s).",0.4742857142857143

Effect of transcranial direct current stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex on the gratitude of individuals with heterogeneous ability in an experimental labor market,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042026006&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00217&partnerID=40&md5=5c29358083543bd16689b523ef9fa045,"Gratitude is an important aspect of human sociality, which benefits mental health and interpersonal relationships. Thus, elucidating the neural mechanism of gratitude, which is only now beginning to be investigated, is important. To this end, this study specifies the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) involved in the gratitude of heterogeneous individuals using the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) technique. Previous neural studies have shown the involvement of mPFC in social cognition and value evaluation, which are closely related to gratitude. However, the causal relationship between this neural area and gratitude has not been fully examined and the effect of individual social heterogeneity has been ignored. Meanwhile, behavioral economics studies have proposed that the abilities of employees in the labor market would affect their gratitude and emotional response. Thus, we designed an experiment based on gift exchange game to investigate the relationship between mPFC and gratitude of heterogeneous employees. Before the experiment, participants were asked to perform self-cognition of their abilities through an appropriately difficult task. We then used the effort of participants to imply their gratitude and analyzed the effort levels of employees with different abilities under anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulations. The results showed that employees under anodal stimulation were significantly likely to increase their effort than those under sham stimulation, and employees under cathodal stimulation ranked at the bottom of the list. Moreover, the effort levels of low-ability employees were obviously higher than those of high-ability employees. The cathodal stimulation of mPFC significantly reduced the effort levels of low-ability employees, whereas its anodal tDCS stimulation increased the effort levels of high-ability employees. These outcomes verify the relationship between mPFC and gratitude using tDCS and provided one of the first instances of neural evidence for the incentive mechanism design in the labor market to a certain extent. © 2017 Wang, Wang, Niu, Shang and Li.",0.429042904290429
Likability's effect on interpersonal motor coordination: Exploring natural gaze direction,2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032299000&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01864&partnerID=40&md5=ebeee31ccb5fdcf4757793688c6e54e0,"Although existing studies indicate a positive effect of interpersonal motor coordination (IMC) on likability, no consensus has been reached as for the effect of likability back onto IMC. The present study specifically investigated the causal effect of likability on IMC and explored, by tracking the natural gaze direction, the possible underlying mechanisms. Twenty-two participants were engaged in an interpersonal finger-tapping task with a confederate in three likability conditions (baseline, likable, and unlikable), while wearing an eye tracker. They had to perform finger tapping at their comfort tempo with the confederate who tapped at the same or 1.5 times of the participant's preferred frequency. Results showed that when tapping at the same frequency, the effect of likability on IMC varied with time. Participants coordinated at a higher level in the baseline condition at the beginning of the coordination task, and a facilitative effect of likability on IMC was revealed in the last session. As a novelty, our results evidenced a positive correlation between IMC and the amount of gaze onto the coordination partner's movement only in the likable condition. No effect of likability was found when the confederate was tapping at 1.5 times of the participant's preferred frequency. Our research suggests that the psychosocial property of the coordinating partner should be taken into consideration when investigating the performance of IMC and that IMC is a parameter that is sensitive to multiple factors. © 2017 Zhao, Salesse, Marin, Gueugnon and Bardy.",0.43829787234042555
Validity of self-reported concentration and memory problems: Relationship with neuropsychological assessment and depression,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016284949&doi=10.1080%2f13803395.2017.1301392&partnerID=40&md5=04fbc7ae0b4b3886755054624a9c9442,"Background: This study investigated the validity of self-reported concentration and memory problems (CMP) in residents environmentally exposed to manganese (Mn). Method: Self-report of CMP from a health questionnaire (HQ) and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) was compared to neuropsychological assessment (Trails A&B; Digit Span; Digit Symbol; Similarities; Auditory Consonant Trigrams, ACT; NAB Memory; Rey–Osterrieth, Rey–O, Delayed). Participants included 146 residents from Ohio exposed to air-Mn, with a modeled average concentration of 0.55 µg m–         3 (range = 0.01–4.58). Results: Residents were primarily White (94.5%), aged 30–64 years (M = 51.24), with a minimum of 10 years of residence (range = 10–64). Ninety-four (65.3%) participants reported concentration problems, and 107 residents (73.3%) reported memory problems. More participants endorsed CMP on the SCL-90-R than on the HQ. The prevalence of self-reported CMP was higher for women than for men (88.4% vs. 68.3%). Point-biserial and Pearson’s correlations between self-reported CMP and neuropsychological test scores were nonsignificant and weak for both the HQ (rpb = −.20 to rpb =.04) and the SCL-90-R (r = −.12 to r =.007). Greater levels of depression, anxiety, and female sex predicted having more self-reported CMP on both the HQ and the SCL-90-R. Air-Mn and blood-Mn were not associated with self-reported CMP. Residential distance from the Mn source accounted for a small proportion of variance (sr2 =.04), although depression remained the largest predictor (sr2 =.21). Conclusion: These results indicate that self-report of CMP in Mn-exposed residents appear to be invalid when compared to neuropsychological test scores. The participants’ misperception of having CMP is associated with less education and higher levels of depression. Neuropsychological assessment is recommended to attain valid results. ©, This material is published by permission of the US Environmental Protection Agency.",0.41245136186770426
How do leaders react when treated unfairly?

Specifically, we propose that narcissistic leaders are particularly likely to engage in self-interested behavior when they perceive that their organizations treat them unfairly, and that this self-interested behavior in turn decreases followers' pro-social behavior and voice. Data from a multisource, time-lagged survey of 211 team leaders and 1,205 subordinates provided support for the hypothesized model.

Tests for reliability, convergent validity and receiver operating characteristic analysis were performed to detect the psychometric properties. The EAT-26 demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.822–0.922), test–retest reliability (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.817) and convergent validity(r = 0.450–0.750). The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the cut-off 14 for anorexia nervosa and 15 for bulimia nervosa represented good compromises with approximate sensitivity (0.66–0.68) and specificity (0.85–0.86). Our findings provided evidence that the Chinese version of the EAT-26 was a psychometrically reliable and valid self-rating instrument for identifying people suffering from an eating disorder in Mainland China.

To reveal this process, this study presented the concept of psychological availability, which refers to an individual's belief that they are physically, cognitively, and emotionally ready or confident to engage the self with their colleagues, as a mediator between proactive personality and adjustment. Also, it investigated the relationship between proactive personality and psychological availability and how it was moderated by supportive supervisor relations. We hypothesized, this relationship would be weakened/strengthened when SIEs and HCNs received low/high level of support from their supervisor. This study was conducted as a quantitative study, data was used from 342 SIEs and 342 HCNs working in mainland China. Our finding supported the hypothesis that psychological availability mediated the relationship between proactive personality and their adjustment to an international work environment; in addition, the relationship between proactive personality and psychological availability would be stronger when the level of superiors relations support is high between SIEs and HCNs. This study demonstrated the value of proactive personality as an antecedent effect and supportive supervisor relations as a moderating effect, and investigated how these factors can lead to a sense of psychological availability and boost psychological engagement between SIEs and HCNs in order to improve the adjustment between them. © 2017 Jannesari, Wang, McCall and Zheng.",0.4678111587982833

Male Wistar rats with implanted guide cannulae were trained with a one-trial IA task, then received immediate intracerebral injections of muscimol or saline, and were tested 24 h later. Muscimol injection into the bilateral BLA, or the unilateral VH and contralateral BLA, but not the unilateral VH and ipsilateral BLA, significantly decreased the retention latencies (versus saline treatment).

Increased WM load will increase the amount and difficulty of memory information. Several studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore load-dependent cognition processing according to the time courses of electrophysiological activity or the spatial pattern of blood oxygen metabolic activity. However, the relationships between these two activities and the underlying neural mechanism are still unclear. In this study, using simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI data under an n-back verbal WM task, we modeled the spectral perturbation of EEG oscillation and fMRI activation through joint independent component analysis (JICA). Multi-channel oscillation features were also introduced into the JICA model for further analysis. The results showed that time-locked activity of theta and beta were modulated by memory load in the early stimuli evaluation stage, corresponding to the enhanced activation in the frontal and parietal lobe, which were involved in stimulus discrimination, information encoding and delay-period activity. In the late response selection stage, alpha and gamma activity changes dependent on the load correspond to enhanced activation in the areas of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, which played important roles in attention, information extraction and memory retention. These findings suggest that the increases in memory load not only affect the intensity and time course of the EEG activities, but also lead to the enhanced activation of brain regions which plays different roles during different time periods of cognitive process of WM. © 2017 Zhao, Li and Yao.",0.4671814671814672

We developed animations for these shapes involving forward/backward/parallel tilts with coincidence/incoincidence of synchronous movement. Results showed significant differences in the inference of friendly/antagonistic atmosphere between coincident and incoincident synchronous movement. In addition, the inference of a friendly atmosphere was affected by the combination of forward tilt with incoincident movement, which may be interpreted as interaction between the shapes, such as responding or providing feedback. This suggests that individuals may infer a friendly/antagonistic communicative atmosphere from both coincident movement and incoincident movement interpreted as an interaction. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.40816326530612246

Cost-benefit decision-making is mediated largely by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which strongly innervates the LH. Therefore, in the current study, we conducted a series of experiments to elucidate the role of the perifornical area of the lateral hypothalamus (PeF-LH) in effort and/or delay-based decision-making. We trained different groups of rats in a delay-based and/or an effort-based form of cost-benefit T-maze decision- making task in which they could either choose to pay the cost to obtain a high reward in one arm or could obtain a low reward in the other arm with no cost. During test days, the rats received local injections of either vehicle or lidocaine4% (0.5 μl/side), in the PeF-LH. In an effort-based decision task, PeF-LH inactivation led to decrease in high reward choice. Similarly, in a delay-based decision task animals’ preference changed to a low but immediately available reward. This was not caused by a spatial memory or motor deficit. PeF-LH inactivation modified decision behavior. The results imply that PeF-LH is important for allowing the animal to pay a cost to acquire greater rewards. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.35858585858585856

Several bodies of research have shown the impact of the PACAP specific receptor PAC1 on fear memory, but the roles of other PACAP receptors in regulating fear stress responses remain to be elucidated. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of genetic deletion of VIPR2 encoding the VPAC2 receptor, which binds both VIP and PACAP, on fear-related memory and on dendritic morphology in the brain regions of the fear circuitry. Male VPAC2 receptor knockout (VPAC2-KO) and littermate wild-type control mice were subjected to Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm. VPAC2-KO mice displayed normal acquisition of fear conditioning, contextual and cued fear memory, but impaired extinction of cued fear memory. Morphological analyses revealed reductions in cell body size and total branch number and length of apical and basal dendrites of prelimbic cortex neurons in VPAC2-KO mice. In addition, Sholl analysis indicated that the amount of dendritic material distal to the soma was decreased, while proximal dendritic material was increased. In the infralimbic cortex, the amount of apical dendritic material proximal to the soma was increased in VPAC2-KO mice, while other indices of morphology did not differ. Finally, there were no differences in dendritic morphology in basolateral amygdala neurons between genotypes. These findings suggest that the VPAC2 receptor plays an important role in the fear extinction processes and the regulation of the dendritic morphology in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.3888888888888889

To investigate how these two motivations affect deception in fairness related moral hypocrisy, we modulated the brain activity in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), the key region for decision making involved in self-centered and other-regarding concerns. After receiving brain stimulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), participants finished a modified dictator game. In the game, they played as proposers to make allocations between themselves and recipients and had a chance to deceive by misreporting their totals for allocations. Results show that deception in moral hypocrisy was decreased after anodal stimulation than sham and cathodal stimulation, only when participants know that their reported totals (appearing fair) would be revealed to recipients rather than being unrevealed. Anodal stimulation also increased offers to recipients than cathodal stimulation regardless of the revelation of reported totals. These findings suggest that enhancing the activity of rTPJ decreased deception caused by impression management rather than self-deception in moral hypocrisy and unfairness through facilitating other-regarding concerns and weakening non-material self-centered motivations. They provide causal evidence for the role of rTPJ in both other-regarding concerns and non-material self-centered motivations, shedding light on the way to decrease moral hypocrisy. © 2017 Tang, Ye, Wang, Zhu, Su, Tong and Liu.",0.40865384615384615

However, its specific role has been controversial. We argue that income inequality and happiness should exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship due to the dynamic competing process between two effects: when income inequality is relatively low, the signal effect will be the dominating factor, in which individuals feel happy because they consider income inequality as a signal of social mobility and expect upward mobility; however, if income inequality level increases beyond a critical point, the jealousy effect will become the dominating factor, in which individuals tend to be unhappy because they are disillusioned about the prospect of upward mobility and jealous of their wealthier peers. This hypothesis is tested in a longitudinal dataset on the United States and a cross-national dataset on several European countries. In both datasets, the Gini coefficient (a common index of a society's income inequality) and its quadratic term were significant predictors of personal happiness. Further examinations of the quadratic relationships showed that the signal effect was only presented in the European data, while the jealousy effect was presented in both datasets. These findings shed new light on our understanding of the relationship between income inequality and personal happiness. © 2017 Yu and Wang.",0.4265402843601896

We previously reported that oral D-serine ingestion inhibited the intake of highly preferred food and promoted the intake of less preferred food in mice. Here, we analyzed the effects of intraperitoneal (IP) D-serine injections on feeding behavior in mice. We assessed the effects of D-serine during both the acquisition and maintenance of a preference for high-fat diets (HFDs). Aversiveness of IP D-serine was analyzed in the conditioned taste aversion paradigm. The effects on food intake were assessed by providing liquid meals with different fat contents. Finally, we measured brain D-serine and L-serine levels after D-serine administration. We found that IP-injected D-serine effectively inhibited the acquisition of a HFD preference, but failed to prevent expression of a previously learned HFD preference. IP-injected D-serine was not sufficient to condition taste aversion. The effect on HFD preference acquisition was associated with increases in D-serine levels in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. IP-injected D-serine most effectively inhibited the intake of liquid meals with high fat content. This effect was dose-dependent, but the responses varied significantly among male C57BL/6J mice. The differential responses to D-serine were consistent among multiple trials in each mouse. In summary, IP-injected D-serine inhibited HFD intake and the acquisition of an HFD preference. Individual mice with the same genetic background showed different sensitivities to D-serine; thus, D-serine sensitivity may be associated with unidentified traits. © 2017 The Authors",0.35655737704918034
"Evaluating distal and proximal explanations for withdrawal: A rejoinder to varnum and kwon's ""the ecology of withdrawal""",2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035811249&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.02085&partnerID=40&md5=c3edfdb6ed0226346ba64c185d966636,"In their 2016 commentary on our theorizing about how youth withdrawal from economic and social participation in Japanese society (i.e., NEET and Hikikomori phenomena) stems from generational inequality of economic opportunities, Varnum and Kwon correctly point out that our explanation for withdrawal is yet untested. They then offered an alternative, evolutionary psychological explanation for withdrawal in which they claim that in resource-rich ecologies like Japan, the option to withdraw from participating in society is a possible life strategy, a strategy that would be much more costly in resource-poor ecologies. While we agree with this premise, we argue that this distal explanatory framework, at least in its current form, has limits in reconciling some of the more recent cross-cultural observations, as well as well-established sociological claims about the causes of withdrawal. Thus we argue that much work remains in refining and expanding the explanatory power of more distal explanations on the issue of withdrawal. Until then, the more proximal and culture-specific explanations are probably the useful and meaningful explanations for the withdrawal phenomenon. © 2017 Norasakkunkit, Uchida and Takemura.",0.3485714285714286

We first constructed a mathematical model based on well-documented characteristics of vection and human behavioral responses to this illusion. We then conducted 10,000 virtual trial simulations using this Oscillating Potential Vection Model (OPVM). OPVM was used to generate simulated vection onset, duration, and magnitude responses for each of these trials. Finally, we compared the properties of OPVM’s simulated vection responses with real responses obtained in seven different laboratory-based vection experiments. The OPVM output was found to compare favorably with the empirically obtained vection data. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.5137614678899083
Bullying and repeated conventional transgressions in Swedish schools: How do gender and bullying roles affect students’ conceptions?,2017,28,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026783827&doi=10.1002%2fpits.22054&partnerID=40&md5=fb6f86944d7bbca5b9fb276e81decf84,"Bullying is a moral transgression. Recognizing the importance of approaching bullying from a moral perspective, the present study examines whether children's judgments and reasoning to justify their judgments differ between bullying and repeated conventional transgressions. Our study also explores differences by gender and differences among bullies, victims, and uninvolved students. Participants included 381 students from 13 elementary schools in Sweden. Findings indicate that children judge bullying as more wrong than repeated conventional transgressions; use moral reasons more frequently in their justifications about bullying than about repeated conventional transgressions; and use conventional reasons more frequently to justify their judgments on repeated conventional transgressions as compared with bullying. Female students and nonbullies judged bullying and repeated conventional transgressions as more wrong and used moral reasons more frequently in their justifications of judgments of bullying than did male students and bullies. Male students reported bullying more than did female students. Implications for practice are also discussed. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.5
The neural basis of human female mate copying: An empathy-based social learning process,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020211448&doi=10.1016%2fj.evolhumbehav.2017.05.006&partnerID=40&md5=c1f56764f048a1bffbc6aa661c1e847f,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural basis of human female mate copying. Consistent with previous mate copying effects, women's attractiveness ratings for target males increased significantly greater after the males were observed paired with romantic partners versus ordinary friends, and this was mainly accounted for by males being paired with attractive romantic partners. Attractiveness ratings for male targets were lower when they were paired with an attractive opposite-sex friend. The fMRI data showed that the observational learning process in mate copying recruited brain regions including the putamen, the inferior frontal gyrus, the middle cingulate, the SMA, the insula, and the thalamus – areas overlapped with brain regions involved in empathy. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals in higher cognitive functions including the parieto-frontal network, as well as visual areas, were significantly more activated when women evaluated males in the friend versus romantic-partner context, whereas brain regions were not more active in the reverse comparison, suggesting that less cognitive functions or as least no more functions were involved in evaluating the quality of target males in the romantic-partner context than in the friend context. Further analysis indicated that specific brain regions related to the evaluation process of mate copying were associated with bilateral fusiform gyrus (FFA). Thus, results are consistent with a view that mate copying is a domain-specific adaptation involving an empathy-based social-learning process that is also associated with reduced cognition. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.4297872340425532

Seventy Chinese undergraduate students generated personal reflective journals and eight participants' journals were selected to enter into the narrative-oriented inquiry. Our analysis revealed a number of primary themes based on which we produced a meta-story. The supplements of the story were exacted for further critical cross-case discussion. The finding indicated that the multifaceted development of mindful agency involved learning methods, emotional regulation, strategic thinking, and awareness of planning, openness to experience, self-acceptance and self-esteem, and learning engagement, with enhanced sense of personal awareness and awakening. The coaching was supportive for students to foster positive self-identities and become more reflective, mindful, and self-determined. © 2017 Wang, Law, Li, Xu and Pang.",0.47297297297297297
Punish the perpetrator or compensate the victim?

Previous studies mostly investigated these behaviors in gain rather than loss context, and few study made direct comparison between these two behaviors. We conducted three experiments to investigate third-party punishment and third-party compensation in the gain and loss context. Participants observed two persons playing Dictator Game to share an amount of gain or loss, and the proposer would propose unfair distribution sometimes. In Study 1A, participants should decide whether they wanted to punish proposer. In Study 1B, participants decided to compensate the recipient or to do nothing. This two experiments explored how gain and loss contexts might affect the willingness to altruistically punish a perpetrator, or to compensate a victim of unfairness. Results suggested that both third-party punishment and compensation were stronger in the loss context. Study 2 directly compare third-party punishment and third-party compensation in the both contexts, by allowing participants choosing between punishment, compensation and keeping. Participants chose compensation more often than punishment in the loss context, and chose more punishments in the gain context. Empathic concern partly explained between-context differences of altruistic compensation and punishment.

Participants evaluated the illusion strength in reference to the physical flicker of a gray object presented in central vision. The results show that the green or blue object presented on the red background caused the illusion. In Experiment 2, the effect of retinal eccentricity on the illusion was tested. The results showed that the illusion was weak in central vision but became stronger as the retinal eccentricity of the objects’ presentation increased. In Experiment 3, optimal luminance conditions for the illusion were explored with the green and blue objects. The illusion was strong when object luminance was lower than background luminance and the optimal luminance for the blue object was lower than that for the green object. We propose a tentative theory for the illusion and discuss its cause. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.3941176470588235
Does combat exposure affect well-being in later life? the VA Normative aging study,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021757248&doi=10.1037%2ftra0000282&partnerID=40&md5=5d4270a32ecb28a8cf390087390f07b3,"Objective: Combat exposure can have long-Term negative effects in later life; although aspects of service may be appraised positively, the long-Term positive effects of combat on well-being in later life is largely unknown. Method: The sample included 1,006 male veterans from the VA Normative Aging Study, surveyed by mail in 1986, 1990, and 1991 (Mage = 65.5 years, SD = 7.3). They reported on their combat exposure, desirable appraisals of military service, unit cohesion, dispositional optimism, self-rated health, and psychological well-being (PWB), as well as age, military rank, and education. Perceived positive aspects (PPA) of military service was postulated to mediate the effects of combat exposure on PWB. Structural equation modeling was used to examine both mediating and moderating effects. Results: Age, combat exposure, and optimism had independent effects on PPA, but optimism did not moderate the effect of combat exposure on PPA. Combat exposure had only indirect effects on PWB through PPA, controlling for the direct effects of optimism. Education had no direct effects on the positive outcomes but did have indirect effects through optimism. Conclusion: Combat exposure contributes to positive well-being in later life, indirectly through positive appraisals, and this effect was independent of optimism. Thus, these results support the idea that combat veterans should be encouraged to focus on positive aspects of military service, which may serve as resilience resources to facilitate optimal aging. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.49099099099099097

Recently, non-pharmacological methods, such as physical activity and mental training practices, have emerged as promising low-cost methods to slow the progression of age-related memory decline. In this study, we investigated if Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) and Baduanjin modulated the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in different frequency bands (low-frequency: 0.01–0.08 Hz; slow-5: 0.01–0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027–0.073 Hz) and improved memory function. Older adults were recruited for the randomized study. Participants in the TCC and Baduanjin groups received 12 weeks of training (1 h/day for 5 days/week). Participants in the control group received basic health education. Each subject participated in memory tests and fMRI scans at the beginning and end of the experiment. We found that compared to the control group: (1) TCC and Baduanjin groups demonstrated significant improvements in memory function; (2) TCC increased fALFF in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the slow-5 and low-frequency bands; and (3) Baduanjin increased fALFF in the medial PFC in the slow-5 and low-frequency bands. This increase was positively associated with memory function improvement in the slow-5 and low-frequency bands across the TCC and Baduanjin groups. Our results suggest that TCC and Baduanjin may work through different brain mechanisms to prevent memory decline due to aging. © 2017 Tao, Chen, Liu, Egorova, Xue, Liu, Zheng, Li, Wu, Hu, Wang, Chen and Kong.",0.4036697247706422

By using a task-switching paradigm, the present study investigated how positive emotion affected cognitive flexibility and the underlying neural mechanisms. After viewing pictures of different emotional valence (positive, negative, or neutral), participants discriminated whether a target digit in a specific color was odd or even. After a series of trials, the color of target stimuli was changed, i.e., the switch condition. Switch costs were measured by the increase of reaction times (RTs) in the switch trials compared to those in the repeat trials. Behavior results indicated that switch costs significantly decreased in the positive emotional condition, and increased in the negative emotional condition, compared with those in the neutral condition. Imaging data revealed enhanced activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in switch trials than those in repeat trials. Moreover, the interaction between emotion (positive, negative, neutral) and trial type (repeat vs. switch) was significant. For switch trials, the activation of dACC decreased significantly in the positive condition, while increased significantly in the negative condition compared to neutral condition. By contrast, for repeat trials, no significant difference was observed for the activation of dACC among three emotional conditions. Our results showed that positive emotions could increase the cognitive flexibility and reduce the conflict by decreasing the activation of dACC. © 2017 Wang, Chen and Yue.",0.4533333333333333
Moderate partially reduplicated conditioned stimuli as retrieval cue can increase effect on preventing relapse of fear to compound stimuli,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040968987&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00575&partnerID=40&md5=c6dd53194c0ed23016cdee2c8c071ce7,"The theory of memory reconsolidation argues that consolidated memory is not unchangeable. Once a memory is reactivated it may go back into an unstable state and need new protein synthesis to be consolidated again, which is called “memory reconsolidation”. Boundary studies have shown that interfering with reconsolidation through pharmacologic or behavioral intervention can lead to the updating of the initial memory, for example, erasing undesired memories. Behavioral procedures based on memory reconsolidation interference have been shown to be an effective way to inhibit fear memory relapse after extinction. However, the effectiveness of retrieval-extinction differs by subtle differences in the protocol of the reactivation session. This represents a challenge with regard to finding an optimal operational model to facilitate its clinical use for patients suffering from pathogenic memories such as those associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. Most of the laboratory models for fear learning have used a single conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US). This has simplified the real situation of traumatic events to an excessive degree, and thus, limits the clinical application of the findings based on these models. Here, we used a basic visual compound CS model as the CS to ascertain whether partial repetition of the compound CSs in conditioning can reactivate memory into reconsolidation. The results showed that the no retrieval group or the 1/3 ratio retrieval group failed to open the memory reconsolidation time window. The 2/3 repetition retrieval group and the whole repetition retrieval group were able to prevent fear reinstatement, whereas only a 2/3 ratio repetition of the initial compound CS as a reminder could inhibit spontaneous recovery. We inferred that a retrieval-extinction paradigm was also effective in a more complex model of fear if a sufficient prediction error (PE) could be generated in the reactivation period. In addition, in order to achieve an optimal effect, a CS of moderate discrepancy should be used as a reminder. © 2017 Li, Chen, Caoyang, Wu, Jie, Xu and Zheng.",0.38317757009345793

The aim of this study was to compare the psychosocial adjustment and behaviours of left-behind children and migrant children. Methods: Full data were available for 761 left-behind children and 1,392 migrant children aged 11 to 17 in Zhejiang Province, eastern China. Participants completed a questionnaire focusing on migration status, risks behaviours, and psychological well-being, measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: There were more left behind girls and more urban migrant boys (p <.001). The mean scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were all higher in left-behind children than migrant children: for emotional symptoms (3.82 vs. 3.03, p <.001), conduct problems (2.55 vs. 2.41, p =.048), hyperactivity (4.25 vs. 3.81, p <.001), and total difficulties (13.46 vs. 12.00, p =.020), whereas the prosocial score was lower (6.68 vs. 6.90, p <.001), all indicating lower levels of well-being in left-behind children. Overall, 11.4% of left-behind children and 8.8% of migrant children scored in the abnormal range for total difficulties. Left behind girls were particularly vulnerable to emotional problems. Left-behind children were more likely to admit to stealing and cheating on exams, but there were no differences in other risks behaviours, such as smoking and drinking. Conclusions: Migration with parents, rather than separation from parents, was associated with better psychological well-being and fewer behavioural problems. Our findings have relevance for migrant parents in helping to inform decisions about where to raise their children as well as for policymakers in countries where migration is a major issue. When children are left behind, models of community support need to be considered, especially for those who are most vulnerable. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",0.40794223826714804

These tasks raise and answer important questions about how individuals decide to terminate searches in cases in which the number of targets in each display is unknown. Even when asked to find every target, individuals quit before exhaustively searching a display. Because a failure to notice targets can have profound effects (e.g., missing a malignant tumor in an X-ray), it is important to develop strategies that could limit such errors. Here, we explored the impact of different reward patterns on these failures. In the Neutral condition, reward for finding a target was constant over time. In the Increasing condition, reward increased for each successive target in a display, penalizing early departure from a display. In the Decreasing condition, reward decreased for each successive target in a display. The experimental results demonstrate that observers will forage for longer (and find more targets) when the value of successive targets increases (and the opposite when value decreases). The data indicate that observers were learning to utilize knowledge of the reward pattern and to forage optimally over the course of the experiment. Simulation results further revealed that human behavior could be modeled with a variant of Charnov’s Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) (Charnov, 1976) that includes roles for reward and learning. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.423728813559322

The goal is to discover the state of a system that consists of a set of independent components. The state of the system depends on the states of the individual components and is classified as working if at least a pre-specified number of components are working, otherwise it is said to be down. During the diagnostic testing procedure, components are tested one by one, in a pre-specified order. The resulting test sequencing problem is NP-hard with general precedence constraints even when the tests are perfect, in which case a component test always reports the correct state of the component. In this work, we will also consider the additional complication that tests can be imperfect, meaning that a test can report a component to be working when it is actually down, and vice versa.

In this study, a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to measure white matter integrity in young adults with SPD. A total of 49 subjects were recruited and categorized into SPD and control group based on their clinical behavioral tests. To localize regions with abnormal white matter integrity in SPD, the voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) on the whole brain was performed by TBSS.

Our result demonstrated that SPD had significantly lower white matter integrity than controls in superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), superior corona radiata (SCR), internal capsule, external capsule, sagittal stratum, fornix/stria terminalis and midbrain structures. Correlation analysis showed that the observed abnormalities in internal capsule and stria terminalis were correlated with the severity of dependence and behavioral assessments.

Yet, little is known regarding the cognitive processes underlying such impaired cortisol recovery. The present study examined the effect of post-event processing (PEP), referred to as repetitive thinking about social situations, on cortisol recovery following a social stressor. Forty-two non-clinical university students (23 women, 19 men, mean age = 22.0 ± 2.0 years) completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), followed by a thought sampling procedure which assessed the frequency of PEP reflecting the TSST. A growth curve model showed PEP and social anxiety interactively predicted cortisol recovery. In particular, PEP predicted impaired cortisol recovery in those with low levels of social anxiety but not in those with high levels of social anxiety, which contradicted the initial hypothesis. These findings suggest that PEP is differentially associated with cortisol recovery depending on levels of social anxiety. The possible mechanisms underlying these findings were discussed in terms of protective inhibition framework. © 2017 Maeda, Sato, Shimada and Tsumura.",0.4819277108433735

We hypothesized that unfavorable working conditions (high job demands, low job control/decision latitude, and low social support at work) and individual differences concerning sleep/wake-related variables (high flexibility, high morningness, and low languidity) would be related to workaholism measured 2-3 years later. Survey data stemmed from a prospective cohort of shift-working nurses (N = 1,308). The results showed that social support at work was negatively related to workaholism, whereas job demands were positively related to workaholism. Flexibility in terms of time for working/sleeping was also positively related to workaholism. The analyses further revealed that workaholism was inversely associated with age as well as having a child or having a child move in. Conjointly, the independent variables explained 6.4% of the variance in workaholism, while their relative importance was small overall. After controlling for all other independent variables, high job demands had the strongest relationship (small-to-medium) with workaholism. This implies that less pressure from the external environment to work excessively hard may prevent an increase in workaholic behaviors. Overall, the study adds to our understanding of the relationships between working conditions, individual differences, and workaholism. © 2017 Andreassen, Bakker, Bjorvatn, Moen, Magerøy, Shimazu, Hetland and Pallesen.",0.41089108910891087

Using a nationwide sample of employees (N = 2010) from state-owned, private and foreign-invested companies, we explored intergenerational differences and similarities in basic human values. We found an increasing openness to change across cohorts, and a surprising upswing in conservation in the post-reform generation. However, we also found similarities in conservation, self-enhancement, and self-transcendence values between the pre-reform and post-reform generations. We also explored how the effects of values on employee behaviors changed across cohorts. The implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.48031496062992124
Do Americans Have a Preference for Rule-Based Classification?,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032669701&doi=10.1111%2fcogs.12463&partnerID=40&md5=4686722cec3524bb8106a45f5282b3fe,"Six experiments investigated variables predicted to influence subjects’ tendency to classify items by a single property (rule-based responding) instead of overall similarity, following the paradigm of Norenzayan et al. (, Cognitive Science), who found that European Americans tended to give more “logical” rule-based responses. However, in five experiments with Mechanical Turk subjects and undergraduates at an American university, we found a consistent preference for similarity-based responding. A sixth experiment with Korean undergraduates revealed an effect of instructions, also reported by Norenzayan et al., in which classification instructions led to majority rule-based responding but similarity instructions led to overall similarity grouping. Our American subjects showed no such difference and used similarity more overall. We conclude that Americans do not have a preference for rule responding in classification and discuss the differences between tasks that reliably show strong rule or unidimensional preferences (category construction and category learning) in contrast to this classification paradigm.

Decoding of self-paced lower-limb movement intention: A case study on the influence factors,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041005426&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00560&partnerID=40&md5=c1cc0455a9d5a38b993bd4fd89ce4171,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have been applied as new rehabilitation tools for motor disabled individuals. Active involvement of cerebral activity has been shown to enhance neuroplasticity and thus to restoremobility. Various studies have focused on the detection of upper-limb movement intention, while the fewer study has investigated the lower-limb movement intention decoding. This study presents a BMI to decode the self-paced lower-limb movement intention, with 10 healthy subjects participating in the experiment. We varied four influence factors including the movement type (dorsiflexion or plantar flexion), the limb side (left or right leg), the processing method (time-series analysis based on MRCP, i.e., movement-related cortical potential or frequency-domain estimation based on SMR, i.e., sensory motor rhythm) and the frequency band (e.g., delta, theta, mu, beta and MRCP band at [0.1 1] Hz), to estimate both single-trial and sample-based performance. Feature analysis was then conducted to show the discriminant power (DP) and brain modulations. The average detection latency was -0.334 ± 0.216 s in single-trial basis across all conditions. An average area under the curve (AUC) of 91.0 ± 3.5% and 68.2 ± 4.6% was obtained for the MRCP-based and SMR-based method in the classification, respectively. The best performance was yielded from plantar flexion with left leg using time-series analysis on the MRCP band. The feature analysis indicated a cross-subject consistency of DP with the MRCP-based method and subject-specific variance of DP with the SMR-based method. The results presented here might be further exploited in a rehabilitation scenario. The comprehensive factor analysis might be used to shed light on the design of an effective brain switch to trigger external robotic devices. © 2017 Liu, Chen, Chavarriaga, Pei and Millán.",0.41379310344827586

The current study sought to address the roles of narcissism and promotion focus on optimism bias in risk perception in aviation context. Participants were 239 male flight cadets from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China who completed the Narcissistic Personality Inventory-13, the Work Regulatory Focus Scale, and an indirect measure of unrealistic optimism in risk perception, which measured risk perception for the individual and the risk assumed by other individuals performing the same task. Higher narcissism increased the likelihood of underestimating personal risks, an effect that was mediated by high promotion focus motivation, such that high narcissism led to high promotion focus motivation.

The influence of empathy and morality of violent video game characters on gamers' aggression,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033794903&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01863&partnerID=40&md5=92510efbbe084b1f980356983209de5d,"According to the General Aggression Model, situational factors (such as the game characters) and personal factors both affect a gamer's acquisition of aggressive behavior. Previous studies have found not only that the surface features of game characters, such as appearance and clothing, but also that their inherent characteristics, such as morality and identity, can influence a gamer's attitude and behavior. Research has also shown that empathy, as a personal factor, can protect gamers from the impact of media violence. However, past research has focused primarily on single factors affecting the player rather than more comprehensive investigations. This study investigates the influence of the game character's moral features and levels of empathy on the gamer's aggression. The participants were 120 Chinese university students (61 females and 59 males) with ages ranging from 17 to 27 years. Participants first completed a series of questionnaires: a user experience questionnaire, a video game questionnaire, the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, and a modified version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. All participants then had 5 min of practice playing a violent video game. They were then divided into three groups: a high empathy group, a low empathy group, and a no empathy group. After the practice, participants in the high and low empathy groups read empathy materials relating to the game characters; participants in the no empathy group began formal gameplay. All participants played the game for 20 min. Finally, participants were required to complete the Scale of Hostility Status questionnaire, the Implicit Aggression Test, and the Competitive Reaction Time Test. The results show that empathy and the morality of game characters both influence aggression, but empathy affected aggression differently in the participants playing justified roles (i.e., killing others for a moral reason in the game) compared to those playing unjustified roles (i.e., killing others for immoral reasons in the game). In the high empathy condition, the implicit aggression of justified players was significantly higher than those playing unjustified roles. However, high empathy does not always play a protective role, and its effect is restricted by the features of the game characters. © 2017 Gao, Weng, Zhou and Yu.",0.4139941690962099
Social value orientation modulates the processing of outcome evaluation involving others,2017,44,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041837876&doi=10.1093%2fscan%2fnsx102&partnerID=40&md5=a037916123bd770dc682f35099c29f5b,"Social value orientation (SVO) is a stable personality trait that reflects how people evaluate interdependent outcomes for themselves and others in social environments. Generally, people can be classified into two types: proselfs and prosocials. The present study examined how SVO affects the processing of outcome evaluation temporally using the event-related potential (ERP). Young adults with two different SVO types participated in a simple gambling task in which they received outcome distributions for themselves and others. The results showed that for the self outcomes, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) was more negative for self-loss than self-gain, and the P3 and late positive component (LPC) was larger for self-gain than self-loss in both prosocial and proself groups. For the other outcomes, however, the FRN, P3 and LPC were sensitive to other's gain and loss only in the prosocial group but not in the proself group. These findings suggest that outcomes for oneself and others are processed differently at different stages of evaluation processing in the brains of individuals with distinct SVOs. © The Author (2017).",0.4470588235294118

The current study explored this possible relationship in an adult word-learning context. We assessed whether the relationship between cross-modal working memory binding and lexical development would be observed in the learning of associations between unfamiliar spoken words and their semantic referents, and whether it would vary across experimental conditions in first- and second-language word learning. A group of English monolinguals were recruited to learn 24 spoken disyllable Mandarin Chinese words in association with either familiar or novel objects as semantic referents. They also took a working memory task in which their ability to temporarily bind auditory-verbal and visual information was measured. Participants’ performance on this task was uniquely linked to their learning and retention of words for both novel objects and for familiar objects. This suggests that, at least for spoken language, cross-modal working memory binding might play a similar role in second language-like (i.e., learning new words for familiar objects) and in more native-like situations (i.e., learning new words for novel objects). Our findings provide new evidence for the role of cross-modal working memory binding in L1 word learning and further indicate that early stages of picture-based word learning in L2 might rely on similar cognitive processes as in L1. © 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4291845493562232

Within that context, the purpose of the present study was to test Agnew's general strain theory and the peer deviancy training hypothesis by utilizing structural equation modeling to empirically examine pathways linking punitive parenting to bullying perpetration and bullying victimization. This study adds to the literature in two important ways. First, potential mediating linkages between punitive parenting and bullying perpetration and bullying victimization were examined, including socially withdrawn behavior and deviant peer affiliation. Second, these relationships were considered in a longitudinal sample of South Korean adolescents, which is a novel examination given that parenting in South Korea is guided largely by Confucianism which reinforces parental control, restrictiveness, and a punitive nature. Results indicate that: (1) punitive parenting is directly related to bullying perpetration but not bullying victimization; (2) punitive parenting was found to have indirect effects only on bullying perpetration; (3) deviant peer affiliation increased the likelihood of bullying perpetration and victimization; and (4) socially withdrawn behavior only affected bullying perpetration via its effect on deviant peer affiliation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.48633879781420764
Changing artificial playback speed and real movement velocity do not differentially influence the excitability of primary motor cortex during observation of a repetitive finger movement,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041015508&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00546&partnerID=40&md5=9f087afb6eb7ecae6cf12bfe699277e6,"Action observation studies have investigated whether changing the speed of the observed movement affects the action observation network. There are two types of speed-changing conditions; one involves '‘changes in actual movement velocity,'' and the other is '‘manipulation of video speed.'' Previous studies have investigated the effects of these conditions separately, but to date, no study has directly investigated the differences between the effects of these conditions. In the '‘movement velocity condition,'' increased velocity is associated with increased muscle activity; however, this change of muscle activities is not shown in the '‘video speed condition.'' Therefore, a difference in the results obtained under these conditions could be considered to reflect a difference in muscle activity of actor in the video. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of different speed-changing conditions and spontaneous movement tempo (SMT) on the excitability of primary motor cortex (M1) during action observation, as assessed by motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitudes induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A total of 29 healthy subjects observed a video clip of a repetitive index or little finger abduction movement under seven different speed conditions. The video clip in the movement velocity condition showed repetitive finger abduction movements made in time with an auditory metronome, at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 Hz. In the video speed condition, playback of the 1-Hz movement velocity condition video clip was modified to show movement frequencies of 0.5, 2, or 3 Hz (Hz-Fake). TMS was applied at the time of maximal abduction and MEPs were recorded from two right-hand muscles. There were no differences in M1 excitability between the movement velocity and video speed conditions. Moreover, M1 excitability did not vary across the speed conditions for either presentation condition. Our findings suggest that changing playback speed and actual differences in movement velocity do not differentially influence M1 excitability during observation of a simple action task, such as repetitive finger movement, and that it is not affected by SMT. In simple and meaningless observational task, people might not be able to recognize the difference in muscle activity of actor in the video. © 2017 Moriuchi, Matsuda, Nakamura, Matsuo, Nakashima, Mitsunaga, Hasegawa, Ikio, Koyanagi and Higashi.",0.45892351274787535

Each kind included eight film clips, and a total of 64 emotional films were viewed by 110 participants. We analyzed both the subjective experience (valence, arousal, motivation, and dominance) and physiological response (heart rate and respiration rate) to the presentation of each film. The results of the subjective ratings indicated that our set of 64 films successfully elicited the target emotions. Heart rate declined while watching high-arousal films compared to neutral ones. Films that expressed amusement elicited the lowest respiration rate, whereas fear elicited the highest. The amount and category of emotional films in this database were considerable.

Antidepressant effect of regular exercise may be implicated in monoaminergic transmission including serotonergic transmission, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and hippocampal neurogenesis, but few general concepts regarding the optimal exercise regimen for stimulating neural mechanisms involved in antidepressant properties have been developed. Here, we examined how 4 weeks of treadmill running at different intensities (0, 15, 25 m/min, 60 min/day, 5 times/week) alters neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which is the major source of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the central nervous system, and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), in which corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons initiate the activation of the HPA axis, during one session of acute treadmill running at different speeds (0, 15, 25 m/min, 30 min) in male Wistar rats, using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. We also examined neurogenesis in the hippocampus using immunohistochemistry for doublecortin (DCX) and assessed depressive-like behavior using the forced swim test after regular exercise for 4 weeks. In the pre-training period, acute treadmill running at low speed, but not at high speed, increased c-Fos positive nuclei in the DRN compared with the sedentary control. The number of c-Fos positive nuclei in the PVN during acute treadmill running was increased in a running speed-dependent manner. Regular exercise for 4 weeks, regardless of the training intensity, induced an enhancement of c-Fos expression in the DRN during not only low-speed but also high-speed acute running, and generally reduced c-Fos expression in the PVN during acute running compared with pre-training. Furthermore, regular treadmill running for 4 weeks enhanced DCX immunoreactivity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), and resulted in decreased depressive-like behavior, regardless of the training intensity. These results suggest that long-term repeated exercise, regardless of the training intensity, improves depressive-like behavior through adaptive changes in the sensitivity of DRN and PVN neurons to acute exercise, and hippocampal neurogenesis. © 2017 Nishii, Amemiya, Kubota, Nishijima and Kita.",0.38485804416403785

So the standard mode of applying null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) fails to adequately separate stable from random effects. Therefore, NHST does not fully convince as a statistical inference strategy. We argue that the replicability crisis is ""home-made"" because more sophisticated strategies can deliver results the successful replication of which is sufficiently probable. Thus, we can overcome the replicability crisis by integrating empirical results into genuine research programs. Instead of continuing to narrowly evaluate only the stability of data against random fluctuations (discovery context), such programs evaluate rival hypotheses against stable data (justification context). © 2017 Witte and Zenker.",0.44360902255639095

Previous behavioral studies showed gender differences in processing infant cues (e.g., crying, laughing or facial attractiveness) and more importantly, the efforts invested in nurturing offspring. The underlying neural mechanisms of processing unknown infant faces provide hints for understanding behavioral differences. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study recruited 32 unmarried adult (16 females and 16 males) participants to view unfamiliar infant faces and rate the attractiveness. Adult faces were also included. Behaviorally, despite that females and males showed no differences in attractiveness ratings of infant faces, a positive correlation was found between female’s (but not male’s) subjective liking for infants and attractiveness ratings of the infant faces. Functionally, brain activations to infant faces were modulated by attractiveness differently in males and females. Specifically, in female participants, activities in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum/Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) were positively modulated by infant facial attractiveness, and the modulation coefficients of these two regions were positively correlated. In male participants, infant facial attractiveness negatively modulated the activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Our findings reveal that different neural mechanisms are involved in the processing of infant faces, which might lead to observed behavioral differences between males and females towards the baby. © 2017 Yin, Fan, Lin, Sun and Wang.",0.5504587155963303

However, spontaneous eyeblinks selectively occur at attentional breakpoints of information processing, suggesting the involvement of spontaneous eyeblink in attentional disengagement from external stimuli. Physiological activity also changes considerably according to attention state. Heart rate decreases when attention is directed at stimuli, while it increases as attention is released. Therefore, we examined the temporal dynamics between spontaneous eyeblinks and instantaneous heart rate under natural circumstances. Our results showed that the heart rate momentarily increases after each spontaneous eyeblink while participants were freely viewing a movie or listening to a story. This phenomenon was consistently observed even when the participants were placed in a dark room. The skin conductance level on the fingers also increased after each spontaneous eyeblink, suggesting that the blink-related heart rate acceleration was induced by an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity. In contrast, no heart rate acceleration was observed to accompany spontaneous eyeblinks at rest or volitional eyeblinks. These results demonstrated that the generation of spontaneous eyeblinks and the activity of the autonomic nervous system are correlated under attentional influence of natural circumstances. © 2017 The Authors",0.4898989898989899

However, the mechanisms that nurture the proenvironment attitudes of employees remain unclear. By juxtaposing Taoist philosophy and Aldo Leopold's land ethic, this paper explores how the former can theoretically advance the latter from a cultural and philosophical microfoundational perspective. Taoism, which treats human beings and the natural environment as components of an integral oneness, has important implications for both Taoist leadership behaviours and the management of sustainability. We posit that the attributions of Taoist leadership—rejection of domination, reverse thinking, and selflessness—can nurture employee proenvironment attitudes. Using the narratives of Chinese leaders and employees, our research empirically shows that the proenvironment attitudes and green behaviours of employees can be nurtured through Taoist leadership. Our paper contributes the field of sustainability management by suggesting Taoism as a cultural and philosophical microfoundation for sustainability.

Diffusion tensor imaging tractography reveals disrupted white matter structural connectivity network in healthy adults with insomnia symptoms,2017,25,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041045987&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00583&partnerID=40&md5=430091e1eddff1996a973e118883c802,"Neuroimaging studies have revealed that insomnia is characterized by aberrant neuronal connectivity in specific brain regions, but the topological disruptions in the white matter (WM) structural connectivity networks remain largely unknown in insomnia. The current study uses diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to construct the WM structural networks and graph theory analysis to detect alterations of the brain structural networks. The study participants comprised 30 healthy subjects with insomnia symptoms (IS) and 62 healthy subjects without IS. Both the two groups showed smallworld properties regarding their WM structural connectivity networks. By contrast, increased local efficiency and decreased global efficiency were identified in the IS group, indicating an insomnia-related shift in topology away from regular networks. In addition, the IS group exhibited disrupted nodal topological characteristics in regions involving the fronto-limbic and the default-mode systems. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the topological organization of WM structural network connectivity in insomnia. More importantly, the dysfunctions of large-scale brain systems including the fronto-limbic pathways, salience network and default-mode network in insomnia were identified, which provides new insights into the insomnia connectome. Topology-based brain network analysis thus could be a potential biomarker for IS. © 2017 Lu, Dai, Couto, Liu, Chen, Lu, Tang, Tie, Chen, He, Xiang and Yuan.",0.39805825242718446
Interrogating the construct of communicative competence in language assessment contexts: What the non-language specialist can tell us,2017,29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011026107&doi=10.1016%2fj.langcom.2016.12.005&partnerID=40&md5=b8657ce67c9c1e75d224c2e20a30b65b,"Models of communicative competence in a second language invoked in defining the construct of widely used tests of communicative language ability have drawn largely on the work of language specialists. The risk of exclusive reliance on language expertise to conceptualize, design and administer language tests is that test scores may carry meanings that are misaligned with the values of non-language specialists, that is, those without language expertise but perhaps with expert knowledge in the domain of concern. Neglect of the perspective of lay (i.e., non-linguistic) judges on language and communication is a serious validity concern, since they are the ultimate arbiters of what matters for effective communication in the relevant context of language use. The paper reports on three research studies exploring the validity of rating scales used to assess speaking performance on a number of high-stakes English-language tests developed for professional or general proficiency assessment purposes in Korea, Australia, China, and the UK. Drawing on Jacoby and McNamara's (1999) notion of “indigenous assessment”, each project attempted to identify the values underlying non-language specialists' judgements of spoken communication as they rated test performance or participated in focus-group workshops where they viewed and commented on video- or audio-recorded samples of performance in the relevant real-world domain. The findings of these studies raise the question of whether language can or should be assessed as object independently of the content which it conveys or without regard for the goal and context of the communication. The studies' findings also cast doubt on the notion that the native speaker should always serve as benchmark for judging communicative effectiveness, especially with tests of language for specific purposes, where native speakers and second-language learners alike may lack the requisite skills for the kind of effective interaction demanded by the context. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.4421768707482993

In addition, the extent to which these paths were moderated by infant negative emotionality was also examined. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed prenatally and when infants were 6 months and 2 years old. Maternal unresponsive and overtly negative behaviors and infant negative emotionality were observed when infants were 6 months old. Mothers reported on infant's internalizing and externalizing behaviors when infants were 2 years old. Maternal depressive symptoms were directly associated with higher internalizing behaviors; this path was not mediated by maternal behaviors. Depressive symptoms were unrelated to externalizing symptoms. Infant negative emotionality did not moderate these effects, but was related positively to overtly negative maternal behaviors, and temperament interacted with maternal depressive symptoms to predict unresponsive maternal behaviors. Results suggest that early maternal depressive symptoms, infant negative emotionality, and negative maternal behavior pose risk for infants’ later internalizing behaviors, but the proposed moderated mediation model was not supported. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.46524064171123
The relationship between regional gray matter volume of social exclusion regions and personal self-esteem is moderated by collective self-esteem,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034579680&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01989&partnerID=40&md5=369bb82c6592e93db66bf76529a8f10c,"According to sociometer theory, self-esteem is an internal monitor of positive social bonds to others. Social exclusion can break or threaten social bonds, which might be reflected by the brain structure of social exclusion regions. Thus, self-esteem might be influenced by structurally individual differences in these regions. It has been suggested that self-esteem can be divided into personal (PSE) and collective (CSE) self-esteem and CSE can bring individuals many benefits, such as acceptance, belonging, and social support, which could further maintain or increase their PSE. Based on this, we hypothesized that CSE might moderate the relationship between structurally individual differences in social exclusion regions and PSE. Therefore, in the present study, the moderating effect of CSE on the relationships between PSE and individual differences in regional gray matter volume (rGMV) of 10 social exclusion regions from previous meta-analysis of social exclusion were investigated using voxel-based morphometry. The results showed that CSE played a moderating role in the relationship between PSE and rGMV of the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Specifically, PSE was positively associated with rGMV of left PCC in lower CSE, while there was no significant relationship between PSE and rGMV of left PCC in higher CSE. Therefore, we believe that compared with a higher CSE, because of lack of acceptance, belonging, and social support from valued groups, lower CSE individuals might be more prone to be influenced by social exclusion with decreased rGMV of the left PCC, which makes them more prone to develop lower PSE. © 2017 Wu, Chen, Chen, Guan and Zhao.",0.38735177865612647

The conceptual model, based on the stressor-detachment model, was examined using structural equation modeling. The results suggest that psychological detachment mediates not only the relation between job demands and job anxiety but also that between job demands and CWBs. Furthermore, the relation between job demands and CWBs is sequentially mediated by psychological detachment and job anxiety. Our findings validate the effectiveness of the stressor-detachment model. Moreover, we demonstrate that the underlying mechanism of the relation between job demands and CWBs can be explained by psychological detachment and job anxiety. © 2017 Chen, Li, Xia and He.",0.5373134328358209

The following are required for this illusion to occur. First, the luminance contrast polarity of the wavy line against the background is reversed at the turning points. Second, the curvature of the wavy line is somewhat low; the right angle is too steep to be perceived as an illusion. This illusion implies that, in order to perceive a gentle curve, it is necessary to satisfy more conditions––constant contrast polarity––than perceiving an obtuse corner. It is notable that observers exactly “see” an illusory zigzag line against a physically wavy line, rather than have an impaired perception. We propose that the underlying mechanisms for the gentle curve perception and those of obtuse corner perception are competing with each other in an imbalanced way and the percepts of corner might be dominant in the visual system. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.423841059602649

However, little is known about how power is mentally represented in children. The current research examines such representations. The influence of vertical information (motor cues) was tested in both an explicit power evaluation task (judge whether labels refer to powerless or powerful groups) and an incidental task (judge whether labels refer to people or animals). The results showed that when power was explicitly evaluated, vertical motor responses interfered with responding in children and adults, i.e., they responded to words representing powerful groups faster with the up than the down cursor key (and vice versa for powerless groups). However, this interference effect disappeared in the incidental task in children. The findings suggest that children have developed a spatial representation of power before they have been taught power–space associations formally, but that they do not judge power spontaneously. © 2017, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0.3782051282051282

Investigating the categorical perception (CP) of emotional valence might help uncover the objective basis of the subjective dichotomy of emotional valence and identify the stage at which this processing of valence information might occur. A judgment task was used in the current study with stimuli from the within- or between-category condition, in which participants were required to decide whether two presented faces showed the same emotion. The results of the behavioral experiment revealed a significant CP effect of emotional valence, with faster RTs and greater accuracy for the between- than for the within-category stimuli. In the ERP experiment, the N170 (peaking at approximately 150-170 ms) was found to reflect the CP effect of emotional valence, with a larger amplitude for the within- than for the between-category condition. In contrast, the P1 component (peaking at approximately 100-130 ms) was insensitive to the CP effect of emotional valence. These results reveal the existence of the CP of emotional valence and indicate that the N170 is its earliest electrophysiological index. Therefore, the categorization of emotional valence not only has an objective neural basis but occurs at a relatively early stage of processing. © 2017 Qiu, Wang and Fu.",0.38095238095238093

However, many are in good health. We tested whether safe, supportive, and nurturing relationships buffer women with a history of childhood maltreatment from poor health outcomes in later life. Methods Participants included women from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study who were involved in an intimate relationship at some point by the time their twin children were 10 years old. Women were initially interviewed in 1999-2000 (mean age = 33 years) and 2, 5, and 7 years later. They reported on their physical and mental health, and their health-risk behaviours. Results Compared with women who did not experience abuse in childhood, women with histories of maltreatment were at elevated risk for mental, physical, and health-risk behaviours, including major depressive disorder, sleep, and substance use problems. Cumulatively, safe, supportive, and nurturing relationships characterized by a lack of violence, emotional intimacy, and social support buffered women with a history of maltreatment from poor health outcomes. Conclusions Our findings emphasize that negative social determinants of health - such as a childhood history of maltreatment - confer risk for psychopathology and other physical health problems. If, however, a woman's current social circumstances are sufficiently positive, they can promote good health, particularly in the face of past adversity.

We further expect these mediation effects to be stronger under dynamic environments. Studies of top executives in China support the theorized moderated-mediation model. By providing evidence for its context-specific benefits, the concept of negotiable fate enhances the dialogue on fate beliefs in the Chinese context and suggests new directions for organizational behavior scholarship beyond China. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.5038759689922481

This study aimed to assess the change in effective connectivity (EC) between the prefrontal cortex (PFC), motor-related areas (MA) and vision-related areas (VA) in the brain network among the resting, simple-driving and car-following states. Twelve young male right-handed adults were recruited to participate in an actual driving experiment. The brain delta [HbO2 ] signals were continuously recorded using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) instruments. The conditional Granger causality (GC) analysis, which is a data-driven method that can explore the causal interactions among different brain areas, was performed to evaluate the EC. The results demonstrated that the hemodynamic activity level of the brain increased with an increase in the cognitive workload. The connection strength among PFC, MA and VA increased from the resting state to the simple-driving state, whereas the connection strength relatively decreased during the car-following task. The PFC in EC appeared as the causal target, while the MA and VA appeared as the causal sources. However, l-MA turned into causal targets with the subtask of car-following. These findings indicate that the hemodynamic activity level of the cerebral cortex increases linearly with increasing cognitive workload. The EC of the brain network can be strengthened by a cognitive workload, but also can be weakened by a superfluous cognitive workload such as driving with subtasks. © 2017 Liu, Zhang, Xu, Huo, Tan, Li and Yuan.",0.3146551724137931

However, the effects of rTMS-MT on cortical function using functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis remain unclear. Ten healthy subjects were recruited to receive rTMS immediately before application of MT. Low frequency rTMS was delivered to the dominant hemisphere and non-dominant hand performed MT over 14 days. The reaction time of Nine-Hole Peg Test and electroencephalography (EEG) in resting condition with eyes closed were recorded before and after rTMS-MT. Functional connectivity was assessed by phase synchronization index (PSI), and subsequently thresholded to construct undirected graphs in alpha frequency band (8–13Hz). We found a significant decrease in reaction time after rTMS-MT. The functional connectivity between the parietal and frontal cortex, and the graph theory statistics of node degree and efficiency in the parietal cortex increased. Besides the functional connectivity between premotor and frontal cortex, the degree and efficiency of premotor cortex showed opposite results. In addition, the number of connections significantly increased within inter-hemispheres and inter-regions.

However, how motives (goals) in emotion regulation operate to shape the regulation of emotion is rarely known. Furthermore, the modulatory role of motivation in the impaired reappraisal capacity and neural abnormalities typical of depressed patients is not clear. Our hypothesis was that (1) approach and avoidance motivation may modulate emotion regulation and the underlying neural substrates; (2) approach/avoidance motivation may modulate emotion regulation neural abnormalities in depressed patients. Methods: Twelve drug-free depressed patients and fifteen matched healthy controls reappraised emotional pictures with approach/avoidant strategies and self-rated their emotional intensities during fMRI scans. Approach/avoidance motivation was measured using Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) Scale. We conducted whole-brain analyses and correlation analyses of regions of interest to identify alterations in regulatory prefrontal-amygdala circuits which were modulated by motivation. Results: Depressed patients had a higher level of BIS and lower levels of BAS-reward responsiveness and BAS-drive. BIS scores were positively correlated with depressive severity. We found the main effect of motivation as well as the interactive effect of motivation and group on the neural correlates of emotion regulation. Specifically, hypoactivation of IFG underlying the group differences in the motivation-related neural correlates during reappraisal may be partially explained by the interaction between group and reappraisal. Consistent with our prediction, dlPFC and vmPFC was differentially between groups which were modulated by motivation. Specifically, the avoidance motivation of depressed patients could predict the right dlPFC activation during decreasing positive emotion, while the approach motivation of normal individuals could predict the right vmPFC activation during decreasing negative emotion. Notably, striatal regions were observed when examining the neural substrates underlying the main effect of motivation (lentiform nucleus) and the interactive effect between motivation and group (midbrain). Conclusions: Our findings highlight the modulatory role of approach and avoidance motivation in cognitive reappraisal, which is dysfunctional in depressed patients. The results could enlighten the CBT directed at modifying the motivation deficits in cognitive regulation of emotion. © Copyright © 2017 Wang, Zhou, Dai, Ji and Feng.",0.4339080459770115

In an experiment, observers categorized morphed images of photographs and human doll faces as ""photograph"" or ""doll"" and evaluated the perceived eeriness of the images. Additionally, we asked the observers to answer questionnaires on behavioral inhibition systems (BIS). The results indicated that individual differences in the BIS score were associated with enhanced eeriness in the objects with a specific human likeness.

The purpose of this research was to test the reliability, factorial validity, concurrent validity and measurement invariance across gender groups of the MSPSS in Chinese parents of children with cerebral palsy. A total of 487 participants aged 21-55 years were recruited to complete the Chinese MSPSS and Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF). Composite reliability was calculated as the internal consistency of the Chinese MSPSS and a (multi-group) confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the factorial validity and measurement invariance across gender. And Pearson correlations were calculated to test the relationships between MSPSS and PSI-SF. The Chinese MSPSS had satisfactory internal reliability with composite reliability values of more than 0.7. The CFA indicated that the original three-factor model was replicated in this specific population. Importantly, the results of the multi-group CFA demonstrated that configural, metric, and scalar invariance across gender groups was supported. In addition, all the three subscales of MSPSS were significant related with PSI-SF.

Additionally, bisexual individuals show increased rates of psychopathology, including problematic alcohol and substance use, above and beyond lesbian and gay individuals. However, not everyone experiencing minority stress reports increased rates of alcohol and substance misuse. Emotion regulation (ER), which plays a critical role in psychopathology in general, is theorized to modulate the link between minority stress and psychopathology. However, it remains largely unknown whether ER plays a role in linking instances of minority stress with substance and alcohol use outcomes. To address the gap, the current study assessed 305 LGB individuals' instances of minority stress, ER, and substance and alcohol use outcomes. We assessed the role of ER in problematic alcohol and substance use among LGB individuals using moderated mediation, where sexual minority status was entered as the moderator, and ER difficulties was entered as the mediator. The results indicated significant indirect effects of minority stress, through ER difficulties, on both problematic alcohol and substance use. However, there was no significant interaction with sexual orientation status, suggesting that ER may be important for all LGB individuals in predicting problematic alcohol and substance use. These results highlight the important role that ER plays between instances of minority stress and substance and alcohol use in LGB individuals, suggesting that ER skills may serve as a novel target for intervention. 2017 Rogers, Seager, Haines, Hahn, Aldao and Ahn.",0.5333333333333333
Neuronal nitric oxide synthase contributes to PTZ kindling-induced cognitive impairment and depressive-like behavior,2017,25,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041961200&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00203&partnerID=40&md5=7a720c38c53f18ec40cab5d3ac88df19,"Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease which is usually associated with psychiatric comorbidities. Depsression and cognition impairment are considered to be the most common psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy patients. However, the specific contribution of epilepsy made to these psychiatric comorbidities remains largely unknown. Here we use pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling, a chronic epilepsy model, to identify neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) as a signaling molecule triggering PTZ kindling-induced cognitive impairment and depressive-like behavior. Furthermore, we identified that both hippocampal MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways were activated in response to PTZ kindling, and the increased MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling activation was paralleled by increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hippocampus. However, the PTZ kindling-induced MAPK, PI3K/AKT signaling activities and the ROS level were attenuated by nNOS gene deficiency, suggesting that nNOS may act through ROS-mediated MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways to trigger cognition deficit and depressive-like behavior in PTZ-kindled mice. Our findings thus define a specific mechanism for chronic epilepsy-induced cognitive impairment and depressive-like behavior, and identify a potential therapeutic target for psychiatric comorbidities in chronic epilepsy patients. © 2017 Zhu, Dong, Han, Huang, Zhang, Xia, Chang, Chao and Yao.",0.38095238095238093
A sensorimotor signature of the transition to conscious social perception: Co-regulation of active and passive touch,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032228102&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01778&partnerID=40&md5=99050437807f21b9a95f43fa94609e03,"It is not yet well understood how we become conscious of the presence of other people as being other subjects in their own right. Developmental and phenomenological approaches are converging on a relational hypothesis: my perception of a ""you"" is primarily constituted by another subject's attention being directed toward ""me."" This is particularly the case when my body is being physically explored in an intentional manner. We set out to characterize the sensorimotor signature of the transition to being aware of the other by re-analyzing time series of embodied interactions between pairs of adults (recorded during a ""perceptual crossing"" experiment). Measures of turn-taking and movement synchrony were used to quantify social coordination, and transfer entropy was used to quantify direction of influence. We found that the transition leading to one's conscious perception of the other's presence was indeed characterized by a significant increase in one's passive reception of the other's tactile stimulations. Unexpectedly, one's clear experience of such passive touch was consistently followed by a switch to active touching of the other, while the other correspondingly became more passive, which suggests that this intersubjective experience was reciprocally co-regulated by both participants. © 2017 Kojima, Froese, Oka, Iizuka and Ikegami.",0.37055837563451777
"The associations between perceived parenting styles, empathy, and altruistic choices in economic games: A study of Chinese children",2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031420653&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01843&partnerID=40&md5=0ab1658a5ac539cb0a25291e36dbd41e,"Parenting styles are critical for fostering children's empathy and prosociality. Yet these relations haven't been well established for Chinese children, and the underlying mechanisms were seldom explored. Drawing upon parental acceptance-rejection theory and empathy-altruism hypothesis, the objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between perceived parenting styles and altruistic behavior of children, and the intervening role of children's empathy and the moderating role of in-group and out-group conditions. What is novel about this study is that it contains both survey data and experimental data. Four hundred and ninety-four children (Mage = 8.92 years) completed four simple binary-choice dictator games which are widely used in the study of other-regarding preferences (concerns for the interests of others). These children also reported their perceived parenting styles. And children's empathy was reported by their mothers. Each child's altruism score, which was used in the subsequent analyses, was derived from the altruistic choices in these games. Mediation analyses indicated that, when age and gender were controlled for, maternal and paternal emotional warmth were positively associated with children's altruism via children's empathy, while maternal and paternal rejection were negatively associated with children's altruism via children's empathy. Multi-group analyses showed that the influences of perceived parenting styles on children's altruistic behavior via children's empathy were consistent for in-group and out-group conditions. These findings suggest that enhancing parental emotional warmth and reducing parental rejection may foster children's empathy, which in turn promote children's altruism. Limitations and future directions of this study were also discussed. © 2017 Guo and Feng.",0.4578313253012048

Our review of empirical research reveals that positive changes in attitudes toward the self and others as a result of mindfulness-enabled practices can play an important role in modulating many mental and physical health problems. Accordingly, we introduce a new concept-the ""mindful self""-and compare it with related psychological constructs to describe the positive changes in self-attitude associated with mindfulness meditation practices or interventions. The mindful self is conceptualized as a mindfulness-enlightened self-view and attitude developed by internalizing and integrating the essence of Buddhist psychology into one's self-system. We further posit that the mindful self will be an important intermediary between mindfulness intervention and mental health problems, and an important moderator in promoting well-being. More generally, we suggest that the mindful self may also be an applicable concept with which to describe and predict the higher level of self-development of those who grow up in the culture of Buddhism or regularly engage in meditation over a long period of time. © 2017 Xiao, Yue, He and Yu.",0.39378238341968913
Early access to lexical-level phonological representations of Mandarin word-forms: evidence from auditory N1 habituation,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013484786&doi=10.1080%2f23273798.2017.1290261&partnerID=40&md5=b5efd673d44cd15accaebf8d0e7be3f1,"An auditory habituation design was used to investigate whether lexical-level phonological representations in the brain can be rapidly accessed after the onset of a spoken word. We studied the N1 component of the auditory event-related electrical potential, and measured the amplitude decrements of N1 associated with the repetition of a monosyllabic tone word and an acoustically similar pseudo-word in Mandarin Chinese. Effects related to the contrastive onset consonants were controlled for by introducing two control words. We show that repeated pseudo-words consistently elicit greater amplitude decrements in N1 than real words. Furthermore, this lexicality effect is free from sensory fatigue or rapid learning of the pseudo-word. These results suggest that a lexical-level phonological representation of a spoken word can be accessed as early as 110 ms after the onset of the word-form. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.33093525179856115

The results showed that the participants in general had significantly poorer performance in the two babble conditions than in quiet and white noise. However, the participants with assimilative and divergent learning styles performed relatively better in Chinese babble, and exhibited stable performance across the three noisy conditions, while the participants with convergent and accommodative learning styles had more impaired performance in both Chinese babble and English babble than in white noise. Moreover, of Kolb's four learning modes, reflective observation had a facilitative effect on listening performance in Chinese babble and English babble.

Specifically, we explored whether marital interaction (marital quality) was associated with symptoms of child depression through parent-child interaction (parenting stress) and parent depressive symptoms. We also explored whether parent-child interaction was associated with symptoms of parent depression through marital interaction and child depressive symptoms. This study was conducted with 256 parent-child dyads, consisting of children with ODD and one of each child's parents. Participants were recruited from 14 primary schools located in northern, eastern, and southwestern China. Results revealed that marital quality predicted symptoms of child depression through the parenting stress, but not parent depressive symptoms; and parenting stress predicted symptoms of parent depression through marital quality, but not through child depressive symptoms. Also, parenting stress significantly and directly predicted parent depressive symptoms. We concluded in families of children with ODD, the association of marital interaction and parent-child interaction on both symptoms of parent and child depression highlighted the mutual effects of the couple subsystem and the parent-child subsystem.

We investigated children's aversion to AI and DI in a procedural justice context. Children of 4-, 6-, and 8- years old were asked to spin a wheel (procedure) to decide how to allocate two different rewards with others. In each condition, they chose between a fair procedure providing equal chances for the two parties to get the bigger reward, and an unfair procedure (either a disadvantageous procedure in the DI condition, or an advantageous procedure in the AI condition). Results showed that children in the two younger age groups had a preference for the unfair procedure that would maximize their own profit in AI, but a greater aversion to the unfair procedure that would disadvantage them in DI. Eight-year-olds, however, had a greater preference for the fair procedure in AI than the 6-year-olds. In addition, the discrepancy between aversion to AI and DI disappeared in the 8-year-olds. The findings indicate children's development of other-oriented concerns such as fairness concern and altruism in procedural justice, consistent with previous findings in distributive justice. © 2017 Qiu, Yu, Li, Cheng and Zhu.",0.40669856459330145
Decreased functional connectivity and disrupted neural network in the prefrontal cortex of affective disorders: A resting-state fNIRS study,2017,49,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020909699&doi=10.1016%2fj.jad.2017.06.024&partnerID=40&md5=b9f2b432a73bb97590c95120117d3729,"Background Affective disorders (AD) have been conceptualized as neural network-level diseases. In this study, we utilized functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the spontaneous hemodynamic activities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the AD patients with or without medications. Methods 42 optical channels were applied to cover the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), which constitute one of the most important affective networks of the brain. We performed resting-state measurements on 28 patients who were diagnosed as having AD and 30 healthy controls (HC). Raw fNIRS data were preprocessed with independent component analysis (ICA) and a band-pass filter to remove artifacts and physiological noise. Results By systematically analyzing the intra-regional, intrahemispheric, and interhemispheric connectivities based on the spontaneous oscillations of Δ[HbO], our results indicated that patients with AD exhibited significantly reduced intra-regional and symmetrically interhemispheric connectivities in the PFC when compared to HC. More specifically, relative to HC, AD patients showed significantly lower locally functional connectivity in the right IFG, and poor long-distance connectivity between bilateral IFG. In addition, AD patients without medication presented more disrupted cortical organizations in the PFC, and the severity of self-reported symptoms of depression was negatively correlated with the strength of intra-regional and symmetrically interhemispheric connectivity in the PFC. Limitations Regarding the measuring technique, fNIRS has restricted measurement depth and spatial resolution. During the study, the subgroups of AD, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar, comorbidity, or non-comorbidity, dosage of psychotropic drugs, as well as different types of pharmacological responses were not distinguished and systematically compared. Furthermore, due to the limitation of the research design, it was still not very clear how pharmacological treatment affected the resting state cortical organization of the prefrontal lobe, and the degree of the effect in patients with AD. Conclusion These results strongly supported that RSFC measured by fNIRS could be a useful and powerful way of delineating the neuropathology of AD. © 2017",0.4384858044164038

Although adolescents with GAD are thought to be at high risk for other mental diseases, the disease-specific alterations have not been adequately explored. Recent studies have revealed the abnormal functional connectivity (FC) in adolescents with GAD. Most previous researches have investigated the static FC which ignores the fluctuations of FC over time and focused on the structures of “fear circuit”. To figure out the alterations of dynamic FC caused by GAD and the possibilities of dynamic FC as biomarkers, we propose an effective approach to identify adolescent GAD using temporal features derived from dynamic FC. In our study, the instantaneous synchronization of pairwise signals was estimated as dynamic FC. The Hurst exponent (H) and variance, indicating regularity and variable degree of a time series respectively, were calculated as temporal features of dynamic FC. By leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), a relatively high accuracy of 88.46% could be achieved when H and variance of dynamic FC were combined as features. In addition, we identified the disease-related regions, including regions belonging to default mode (DM) and cerebellar networks. The results suggest that temporal features of dynamic FC could achieve a clinically acceptable diagnostic power and serve as biomarkers of adolescent GAD. Furthermore, our work could be helpful in understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of adolescent GAD. © 2017 Yao, Liao, Hu, Zhang, Zhao, Zheng, Gutknecht, Majoe, Hu and Li.",0.40772532188841204
Duration compression induced by visual and phonological repetition of Chinese characters,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021256688&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-017-1360-3&partnerID=40&md5=c91b82ea3cc883309e1aef0e349dd2e1,"Our prior experience heavily influences our subjective time. One of such phenomena is repetition compression, that is, repeated stimuli are perceived shorter than novel stimuli. However, most of the studies on repetition compression used identical stimuli, leaving the question whether similar repetition effects could take place in phonological and semantic level repetition. We used Chinese characters to manipulate different levels of repetition in a duration discrimination task. We replicated earlier findings that repetition of visual identical characters shortened the apparent duration and found the repetition compression was spatially independent. Phonological repetition also caused the duration compression though the effect was weaker than the visual repetition. However, we observed no duration compression during the semantic repetition. The results suggest that repetition compression is mediated by visual and phonological representation of a stimulus in an early stage in processing hierarchy. We explained our findings according to the framework of predictive coding. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.5294117647058824

Discreet observations and evaluations, typified by reading, are rarely appreciated as a participatory or creative process.

This research shows that women were actively involved in book-related activities; for example, they exchanged Shakespeare’s playbooks as gifts and preserved rare copies as family treasures. Some female readers even annotated Shakespeare’s works earlier than believed, approximately 40 years before the publication of Harriet Bowdler’s The Family Shakespeare in 1807.

While some studies purport that children conform more with age, others have shown the opposite. The publicity of decision-making might be a major factor influencing the development of children’s conformity behavior. In this study, we recruited 295 Chinese children aged 9–15 years. We observed no significant correlation between children’s age and conformity behaviors when their answers were kept confidential. However, older children showed stronger conformity behaviors when their answers were made public. According to cultural evolutionary theory, with age, children find group acceptance and social recognition increasingly more important, which explains why older children are more likely to conform—namely, doing so has adaptive value. Further research should explore the cross-cultural coherence of this phenomenon and the genuine motivation behind children’s conformity behaviors. Meanwhile, designing a more reliable and valid experiment would also be a fruitful direction. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4189189189189189
On the Counterfactual Nature of Gambling Near-misses: An Experimental Study,2017,21,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017394969&doi=10.1002%2fbdm.2010&partnerID=40&md5=9bec4889eb8a10f65fd0275c58161477,"Research on gambling near-misses has shown that objectively equivalent outcomes can yield divergent emotional and motivational responses. The subjective processing of gambling outcomes is affected substantially by close but non-obtained outcomes (i.e. counterfactuals). In the current paper, we investigate how different types of near-misses influence self-perceived luck and subsequent betting behavior in a wheel-of-fortune task. We investigate the counterfactual mechanism of these effects by testing the relationship with a second task measuring regret/relief processing. Across two experiments (Experiment 1, n = 51; Experiment 2, n = 104), we demonstrate that near-wins (neutral outcomes that are close to a jackpot) decreased self-perceived luck, whereas near-losses (neutral outcomes that are close to a major penalty) increased luck ratings. The effects of near-misses varied by near-miss position (i.e. whether the spinner stopped just short of, or passed through, the counterfactual outcome), consistent with established distinctions between upward versus downward, and additive versus subtractive, counterfactual thinking. In Experiment 1, individuals who showed stronger counterfactual processing on the regret/relief task were more responsive to near-wins and near-losses on the wheel-of-fortune task. The effect of near-miss position was attenuated when the anticipatory phase (i.e. the spin and deceleration) was removed in Experiment 2. Further differences were observed within the objective gains and losses, between “clear” and “narrow” outcomes. Taken together, these results help substantiate the counterfactual mechanism of near-misses. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Behavioral Decision Making Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Behavioral Decision Making Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0.3817427385892116
Limitations of time resources in human relationships determine social structures,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041283769&doi=10.1057%2fpalcomms.2017.14&partnerID=40&md5=c08b43ab4f4999319b49c44d88265292,"The number of social relationships that a single human being can possibly be involved in is limited because individuals face time constraints (that is, time costs) in constructing and maintaining social relationships; furthermore, the distribution of the strength of such relationships (as measured by frequency of social interaction) looks significantly skewed (a power law distribution), that is, a few strong relationships and many weak relationships. This skewedness suggests that the costs and benefits of bonding with others depend on the strength of the social relationships: if it involves uniform costs and benefits, the distribution would not be skewed. The bonding is known as social grooming; that is, humans strategically construct their social relationships, and thus, complex human societies should also be strategically constructed. Therefore, it is important to know their strategies for understanding human societies. Previous studies provide evidence of social grooming strategies by examining the evolution and the difference between the various social grooming methods. However, quantitative laws that are important for theoretically understanding human societies are still open to investigation. Social big data is a particularly powerful tool for finding such laws. Therefore, we analyse data from six communication systems (Twitter, a social networking site providing two types of interactions, an avatar chat, a mobile phone and a short message service). We find a simple quantitative law by which social relationships are constrained Nma (a>1); here, N is the number of social relationships and m is a mean of the strength of those relationships. The fact that deep social relationships require higher costs per relationship than shallow relationships is suggested by a>1 (if the both is equal then a will be 1), because the effect of m on the constraint increases with m. For exploring why a is greater than 1, we conduct an individual-based simulation where social grooming costs are assumed to increase linearly with the strength of social relationships. Our results indicate that this model fits all data sets; that is, it displays an explanation capacity for the phenomenon. In addition, an analysis of this simulation proves our assumption about the social grooming cost increasing with the strength of social relationships as being true. Moreover, it suggests that its gradient increases the width and shallowness of these relationships. The law and its causes suggest that mankind’s evolution of social grooming has enabled changing social structures, and the phenomenon is because of the constraints of the social network generation. These findings will contribute towards an explanation of the evolution of the various social grooming methods of humans and their significantly large social group. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.45774647887323944
"Age, Emotion Regulation, and Affect in Adulthood: The Mediating Role of Cognitive Reappraisal",2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030450243&doi=10.1111%2fjpr.12159&partnerID=40&md5=4ded86db5e6cec7b9d3762f0a1debfb6,"Evidence indicates that older adults experience high levels of emotional well-being. However, little is known empirically about the underlying mechanism of this state. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether emotion regulation mediates the link between age and affect in adulthood. The sample consisted of 516 Japanese participants aged 30 (±1), 50 (±1), and 70 (±1) years, who were registered with an Internet survey company. Cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression were measured as emotion regulation strategies. Positive and negative affect were assessed. Older participants reported lower negative affect than younger participants, while positive affect was not correlated with age. Cognitive reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between age and affect, whereas expressive suppression did not. The results suggested that age-related increase in cognitive reappraisal could contribute to improvements in affect, but that another adaptive form of emotion regulation may mediate the relationship between age and affect. Our study thus indicates that developments in emotion regulation could explain the mechanism of stable everyday affect throughout adulthood, and that researchers should further explore another form of adaptive emotion regulation. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

Childhood experience of nature influences the willingness to coexist with biodiversity in cities,2017,50,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046449529&doi=10.1057%2fpalcomms.2017.71&partnerID=40&md5=e3f54ee94dbb6987d074b322f540a55c,"Although efforts to promote biodiversity in cities around the world have increased, many wild animals (including vertebrates and invertebrates) comprising “urban biodiversity” are unpopular or often regarded as a nuisance by the general public, particularly by those city residents who have had little experience with nature. We conducted a questionnaire survey with 1030 urban residents in Japan to assess their likeability (like and dislike) towards 29 wild animals, and their willingness to have these animals in their neighbourhoods, and examined the effects of childhood experience of nature and socio-demographic factors on these attitudes. In general, people liked smaller birds and mammals, and some insects, but were only willing to have birds and insects near their homes. Females liked birds and mammals but disliked insects and unfavourable animals more than males. Older people expressed willingness to coexist with insects and birds more than younger people. However, childhood experience with nature, particularly collecting insects and plants, was a more important factor than socio-demographics for positive attitudes towards wild animals. Therefore, even though urban residents were unwilling to coexist with many animals, their attitudes can become more positive through increased interaction with wild animals and plants. Biodiversity conservation initiatives in cities should place greater emphasis on providing children with more interaction with biodiversity. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.41904761904761906
Impaired empathy processing in individuals with internet addiction disorder: An event-related potential study,2017,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032007102&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00498&partnerID=40&md5=34cc6b1b5066d0566dbf2329fb5c6262,"Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is associated with deficits in social communication and avoidance of social contact. It has been hypothesized that people with IAD may have an impaired capacity for empathy. The purpose of the current study was to examine the processing of empathy for others’ pain in IADs. Event-related potentials produced in response to pictures showing others in painful and non-painful situations were recorded in 16 IAD subjects and 16 healthy controls (HCs). The N1, P2, N2, P3, and late positive potential components were compared between the two groups. Robust picture _ group interactions were observed for N2 and P3. The painful pictures elicited larger N2 and P3 amplitudes than the non-painful pictures did only in the HC group but not in the IAD group. The results of this study suggest that both of the early automatic and of the later cognitive processes of pain empathy may be impaired in IADs. This study provides psychophysical evidence of empathy deficits in association with IAD. Further studies combining multidimensional measurements of empathy are needed to confirm these findings. © 2017 Jiao, Wang, Peng and Cui.",0.39664804469273746
A wearable vibrotactile biofeedback system improves balance control of healthy young adults following perturbations from quiet stance,2017,21,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026395252&doi=10.1016%2fj.humov.2017.07.006&partnerID=40&md5=eb10722ee0bc9eaaba357a6eb30dd977,"Maintaining postural equilibrium requires fast reactions and constant adjustments of the center of mass (CoM) position to prevent falls, especially when there is a sudden perturbation of the support surface. During this study, a newly developed wearable feedback system provided immediate vibrotactile clues to users based on plantar force measurement, in an attempt to reduce reaction time and CoM displacement in response to a perturbation of the floor. Ten healthy young adults participated in this study. They stood on a support surface, which suddenly moved in one of four horizontal directions (forward, backward, left and right), with the biofeedback system turned on or off. The testing sequence of the four perturbation directions and the two system conditions (turned on or off) was randomized. The resulting reaction time and CoM displacement were analysed. Results showed that the vibrotactile feedback system significantly improved balance control during translational perturbations. The positive results of this preliminary study highlight the potential of a plantar force measurement based biofeedback system in improving balance under perturbations of the support surface. Future system optimizations could facilitate its application in fall prevention in real life conditions, such as standing in buses or trains that suddenly decelerate or accelerate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.4577114427860697
Parenting styles and adolescents' school adjustment: Investigating the mediating role of achievement goals within the 2 × 2 framework,2017,15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031431331&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01809&partnerID=40&md5=6c022fe9566b68aae09d41ca6404386e,"This study examines the multiple mediating roles of achievement goals based on a 2 × 2 framework of the relationships between parenting styles and adolescents' school adjustment. The study sample included 1061 Chinese adolescent students (50.4% girls) between the ages of 12 and 19, who completed questionnaires regarding parenting styles (parental autonomy support and psychological control), achievement goals (mastery approach, mastery avoidance, performance approach, and performance avoidance goals) and school adjustment variables (emotion, students' life satisfaction, school self-esteem, problem behavior, academic achievement, and self-determination in school). A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to test our hypotheses. The results indicated that parental autonomy support was associated with adolescents' school adjustment in an adaptive manner, both directly and through its positive relationship with both mastery and performance approach goals; however, parental psychological control was associated with adolescents' school adjustment in a maladaptive manner, both directly and through its positive relationship with both mastery and performance avoidance goals. In addition, the results indicated that mastery avoidance goals suppressed the relationship between parental autonomy support and adolescents' school adjustment, and performance approach goals suppressed the relationship between this adjustment and parental psychological control. These findings extend the limited literature regarding the 2 × 2 framework of achievement goals and enable us to evidence the mediating and suppressing effects of achievement goals. This study highlights the importance of parenting in adolescents' school adjustment through the cultivation of different achievement goals. © 2017 Xiang, Liu and Bai.",0.5800865800865801
Psychological distress and the incident risk of functional disability in elderly survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake,2017,28,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021137132&doi=10.1016%2fj.jad.2017.06.030&partnerID=40&md5=0998daf892128471ca7d83ef721b446c,"Background We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate whether psychological distress would have increased the incident risk of functional disability after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Methods First phase data pertaining to psychological distress and other lifestyle factors were collected from 1037 subjects aged ≥ 65 years, from June to December 2011, in four affected areas of Miyagi prefecture in Japan. Psychological distress was measured by the Kessler 6-item psychological distress scale (K6), and classified into three categories (K6 score ≤ 9, 10–12, ≥ 13). Outcome data on functional disability were collected from the public Long-term Care Insurance database. Participants were followed up for about 2.6 years. The Cox model was used to calculate the multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results During the follow-up period, 118 participants were certified as incident disability (43.8 disability events per 1000 person-years). Compared with the lowest category (K6 score ≤ 9), participants in the highest category (K6 score ≥ 13) had a significantly higher risk of functional disability (HR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.35-5.18, p = 0.002). In order to consider reverse causality, we conducted analysis excluding all incidents and deaths that occurred within the first year of follow-up, but our findings remained unchanged. Limitations We did not consider all potential confounders and use of appropriate medication. Conclusions The present study has demonstrated that psychological distress was associated with an increased risk of functional disability among elderly survivors of a natural disaster. © 2017 The Authors",0.416289592760181
The effect of monetary punishment on error evaluation in a Go/No-go task,2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025083476&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpsycho.2017.07.002&partnerID=40&md5=4233bba957d99358f8c5f67cbfa58c6f,"Little is known about the effects of the motivational significance of errors in Go/No-go tasks. We investigated the impact of monetary punishment on the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) for both overt errors and partial errors, that is, no-go trials without overt responses but with covert muscle activities. We compared high and low punishment conditions where errors were penalized with 50 or 5 yen, respectively, and a control condition without monetary consequences for errors. Because we hypothesized that the partial-error ERN might overlap with the no-go N2, we compared ERPs between correct rejections (i.e., successful no-go trials) and partial errors in no-go trials. We also expected that Pe amplitudes should increase with the severity of the penalty for errors. Mean error rates were significantly lower in the high punishment than in the control condition. Monetary punishment did not influence the overt-error ERN and partial-error ERN in no-go trials. The ERN in no-go trials did not differ between partial errors and overt errors; in addition, ERPs for correct rejections in no-go trials without partial errors were of the same size as in go-trial. Therefore the overt-error ERN and the partial-error ERN may share similar error monitoring processes. Monetary punishment increased Pe amplitudes for overt errors, suggesting enhanced error evaluation processes. For partial errors an early Pe was observed, presumably representing inhibition processes. Interestingly, even partial errors elicited the Pe, suggesting that covert erroneous activities could be detected in Go/No-go tasks. © 2017 The Authors",0.46887966804979253
Effects of anterior capsulotomy on decision making in patients with refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031407549&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01814&partnerID=40&md5=c695ac83f99f9aca2aab73bca4dfb157,"Despite various lines of evidence implicating impaired decision-making ability in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), neuropsychological investigation has generated inconsistent findings. Although the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuitry has been suggested, the involvement of the cortex has not yet been fully demonstrated. Moreover, it is unknown whether surgical intervention on the CSTC circuitry results in a predicted improvement of decision-making ability of OCD. Here we present a study of decision making based on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to investigate decision making in a large sample of individuals with treatment-resistant OCD with and without anterior capsulotomy (AC). Task performance was evaluated in healthy subjects, individuals with OCD that had not undergone surgery, and postsurgical OCD patients with AC. The latter group was further divided into a short-term postsurgical group and a long-term postsurgical group. We found that the OCD patients without surgery performed significantly worse than the healthy controls on the IGT. There were no significant differences in decision-making between the presurgical OCD patients and those at the short-term postsurgical follow-up. Decision-making ability of the long-term postsurgical OCD patients was improved to the level comparable to that of healthy controls. All clinical symptoms (OCD, depression, and anxiety) assessed by psychiatric rating scales were significantly alleviated post-surgically, but exhibited no correlation with their IGT task performance. Our findings provide strong evidence that OCD is linked to impairments in decision-making ability; that impaired CSTC circuitry function is directly involved in the manifestation of OCD; and that AC related improvements in cognitive functions are caused by long-term plasticity in the brain circuitry. © 2017 Zhang, Chen, Tian, Wang, Xie, Jin, Lin, Gong, Zeljic, Sun, Yang and Zhan.",0.362962962962963
Survival prediction of anxious emotion in advanced cancer patients receiving palliative care,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031039273&doi=10.1002%2fpon.4314&partnerID=40&md5=077dda9915eb967a2b696f70f8d644d4,"Background: This study was carried out to investigate the prognostic value of baseline and dynamic changes in anxious emotion in advanced cancer patients undergoing palliative care. Methods: The association between anxious emotion and survival was investigated in a retrospective sample of 377 consecutive advanced cancer patients receiving palliative care from August 2013 to October 2015 and in an extended follow-up study of 106 of those patients. Results: The prevalence of anxious emotion was 24.93% (94/377) overall, 22.48% (47/209) in men and 27.97% (47/168) in women. Significant associations between baseline anxious emotion and overall survival (OS) were not found in the whole sample or in women. However, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that anxious emotion was an independent prognostic indicator of OS in men (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.811, P =.003). Moreover, findings showed that newly developed anxious emotion was significantly associated with poor OS in all readmitted patients (HR: 5.568, P <.001), in men (HR: 5.104, P =.006) and women (HR: 5.820, P =.004). Conclusions: Our study suggests that anxious emotion, especially dynamic changes in anxious emotion, needs to be monitored in advanced cancer patients; whether targeted interventions would prolong survival requires further studies.

Cooperative marital conflict has long been considered as an important way of managing conflict and may serve as an important context in which hostility might convey during marital interactions. In light of little prior attention placed on the positive side of conflict processes, the main and moderating effects of cooperative marital conflict on youth responses to marital conflict were examined in a sample of 416 2-parent families using a multimethod, 2-year prospective design. Cooperative marital conflict was associated with decreases in youth emotional dysregulation, perceived threat, and behavioral dysregulation, and increases in constructive family representations and coping efficacy. As a specific dimension of cooperation, effective conflict resolution was associated uniquely with elevated youth coping efficacy, and decreased emotional and behavioral dysregulation; marital warmth was associated uniquely with increased constructive family representations. Significant interactions between marital hostility and marital cooperation also were found. These findings highlight the importance of examining cooperation above and beyond hostility in studies of marital conflict in order to better understand youth development during early adolescence. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.4756756756756757

The assessment collected data on demographic characteristics and their perceived caregiver burden, which was compared between spouses and non-spouses. Multiple regression models were built to identify factors associated with caregiver burden. About 64.4% of our study participants were female and the mean age was 42.1 years. Among various relationships to PLH, almost half reported being a spouse. Spouses reported significantly higher caregiver burden than non-spouses. In addition, older age and lower family income were significantly associated with higher level of caregiver burden. Among the subsample of spouses, significantly higher level of caregiver burden was identified among wives. Future studies should give special consideration to address the needs of female spouses in order to reduce their caregiver burden. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.4619883040935672

Frank has argued that love and passion help solve this problem because they make individuals commit voluntarily to the relationship, leading the other party to also be committed with less concern over being cheated on or rejected. Combining this idea with the comparative socio‐ecological approach, we hypothesize that passion will be more pronounced in social environments in which people have greater freedom to choose and replace their partners (i.e., high relational mobility) than in societies in which relationships tend to be more stable and hard to change (i.e., low relational mobility). To test this hypothesis, we compared Americans (living in a society with high relational mobility) and Japanese (living in a society with low relational mobility). As predicted, Americans were more passionate toward their romantic partners than Japanese, and this cultural difference was partially explained by the levels of perceived relational mobility in participants’ local ecology. Moreover, more intense passion was found to lead to greater commitment behaviors in both societies. The importance of taking socioecological factors into consideration for the theory of the adaptive function of interpersonal emotions is also discussed. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4375

Basic values exerted a considerable effect in predicting ideology in most countries, especially in established democracies such as Australia, Finland, Italy, United Kingdom, and Germany. Pattern of relations with the whole set of 10 values revealed that the critical trade-off underlying ideology is between values concerned with tolerance and protection for the welfare of all people (universalism) versus values concerned with preserving the social order and status quo (security).

However, the sustainability and overall impact of such interest is unclear. This study tests the longer-term effects of technology on students' task and course interest. The experimental study was conducted with students in foreign language classes (n = 122): a 12-week experimental trial that included pre- and post-course interest, and a sequence of task interest measures. Employing a counterbalanced design, at three week intervals students engaged in separate speaking tasks with each of a Human and “Chatbot” partner. Students' interest in successive tasks and in the course (pre-post), were used to assess differential partner effects and course interest development trajectories. Comparisons of task interest under different partner conditions over time indicated a significant drop in students' task interest with the Chatbot but not Human partner. After accounting for initial course interest, Structural Equation Modelling indicated that only task interest with the Human partner contributed to developing course interest. While Human partner task interest predicted future course interest, task interest under Chatbot partner conditions did not. Under Chatbot partner conditions there was a drop in task interest after the first task: a novelty effect. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.5804878048780487
Brain interleukin-1 facilitates learning of a water maze spatial memory task in Young Mice,2017,29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041952752&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00202&partnerID=40&md5=f2ea089be28054b798b4c7e26f8dadea,"The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is produced by many types of cells, including immune cells in the periphery and glia and neurons in the brain. The type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1r1) is primarily responsible for transmitting the inflammatory effects of IL-1 and mediates several biological functions by binding to either IL-1α or IL-1β. IL-1β activation is associated with hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Although IL-1β impairs spatial memory under certain pathophysiological conditions, IL-1β may be required for the normal physiological regulation of hippocampal plasticity and memory. In addition, brain IL-1β levels are thought to change in the hippocampus in an age-dependent manner. These findings suggest that IL-1β may have a beneficial, temporary effect on learning and memory in young mice, but the matter remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that hippocampal IL-1β has a beneficial effect on spatial learning and memory in young mice via IL-1r1, which is diminished in adults. We investigated the performance of young (3-month-old) and adult (6-month-old) wild-type mice, IL-1β knockout mice (IL-1βko) and IL-1r1 knockout mice (IL-1r1ko) in learning a spatial memory task with a fixed platform in a water maze (WM) and measured the levels of IL-1β and IL-1α in the hippocampus and cortex of adult and young mice by using homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF). Learning was significantly impaired in the training trials of the WM spatial memory task in young IL-1βko and IL-1r1ko mice but not in adult IL-1βko and IL-1r1ko mice. Moreover, young IL-1r1ko mice but not IL-1βko mice showed an impairment in long-term memory extinction, suggesting that IL-1α might facilitate memory extinction. In this study, the cytokine assay using HTRF did not indicate a higher expression of hippocampal IL-1 in young mice but cortical IL-1β and IL-1α were significantly increased in adult mice. We need to investigate the role of cortical IL-1 and the local IL-1 expression in the hippocampal neurons in the future. © 2017 Takemiya, Fumizawa, Yamagata, Iwakura and Kawakami.",0.40822784810126583

In some cases, these experiences include pain that can be alleviated by “mirror therapy.” Mirror therapy consists of superimposing a mirrored image of the moving intact limb onto the phantom limb. This therapy provides a closed loop between the motor command to the amputated limb and its predicted visual feedback. This loop is also involved in the sense of agency, a feeling of controlling one’s own body. However, it is unclear how mirror therapy is related to the sense of agency over a phantom limb. Using mirror therapy, we investigated phantom limb pain and the senses of agency and ownership (i.e., a feeling of having one’s own body) of the phantom limb. Nine upper-limb amputees, five of whom reported recent phantom limb pain, underwent a single 15-min trial of mirror therapy. Before and after the trial, the participants completed a questionnaire regarding agency, ownership, and pain related to their phantom limb. They reported that the sense of agency over the phantom limb increased following the mirror therapy trial, while the ownership slightly increased but not as much as did the agency. The reported pain did not change; that is, it was comparably mild before and after the trial. These results suggest that short-term mirror therapy can, at least transiently, selectively enhance the sense of agency over a phantom limb, but may not alleviate phantom limb pain. © 2017 Imaizumi, Asai and Koyama.",0.34285714285714286

This study considers these special word order properties in a multilingual acquisition context, examining how Cantonese(L1)-English(L2)-Mandarin(L3) trilingual children process RCs in two Chinese languages differing in exposure conditions. Studying in an English immersion international school, these trilinguals are also under intensive exposure to English. Comparisons of the trilinguals with their monolingual counterparts are made with a focus on the directionality of cross-linguistic influence. The study considers how various factors such as language exposure, structural overlaps in the target languages, typological distance, and language dominance can account for the linguistic abilities and vulnerabilities exhibited by a group of children in a trilingual acquisition context. Twenty-one trilingual 5-to 6-year-olds completed tests of subject- and object- RC comprehension in all three languages. Twenty-four age-matched Cantonese monolinguals and 24 age-matched Mandarin monolinguals served as comparison groups. Despite limited exposure to Mandarin, the trilinguals performed comparable to the monolinguals. Their Cantonese performance uniquely predicts their Mandarin performance, suggesting positive transfer from L1 Cantonese to L3 Mandarin. In Cantonese, however, despite extensive exposure from birth, the trilinguals comprehended object RCs significantly worse than the monolinguals. Error analyses suggested an English-based head-initial analysis, implying negative transfer from L2 English to L1 Cantonese. Overall, we identified a specific case of bi-directional influence between the first and second/third languages. The trilinguals experience facilitation in processing Mandarin RCs, because parallels and overlaps in both form and function provide a transparent basis for positive transfer from L1 Cantonese to L3 Mandarin. On the other hand, they experience more difficulty in processing object RCs in Cantonese compared to their monolingual peers, because structural overlaps with competing structures from English plus intensive exposure to English lead to negative transfer from L2 English to L1 Cantonese. The findings provide further evidence that head noun assignment in object RCs is especially vulnerable in multilingual Cantonese children when they are under intensive exposure to English. © 2017 Chan, Chen, Matthews and Yip.",0.4463276836158192

A random effect meta-analysis model was used to calculate the meta-results of Big Five. Extraversion and openness were the strongest predictor of SNS activities (e.g. gaming, SNS interaction, etc.), while conscientiousness, neuroticism, and agreeableness only correlated with a few of the SNS activities. A meta-analytical structural equation model further demonstrated that plasticity was positively correlated with SNS activities, whereas stability was a negative predictor. Practical implications for social media industry and users were discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.5
A computational model of fraction arithmetic,2017,51,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030112074&doi=10.1037%2frev0000072&partnerID=40&md5=43cbd979a8dd340b96718436b5796367,"Many children fail to master fraction arithmetic even after years of instruction, a failure that hinders their learning of more advanced mathematics as well as their occupational success. To test hypotheses about why children have so many difficulties in this area, we created a computational model of fraction arithmetic learning and presented it with the problems from a widely used textbook series. The simulation generated many phenomena of children's fraction arithmetic performance through a small number of common learning mechanisms operating on a biased input set. The biases were not unique to this textbook series-they were present in 2 other textbook series as well-nor were the phenomena unique to a particular sample of children-they were present in another sample as well. Among other phenomena, the model predicted the high difficulty of fraction division, variable strategy use by individual children and on individual problems, relative frequencies of different types of strategy errors on different types of problems, and variable effects of denominator equality on the four arithmetic operations. The model also generated nonintuitive predictions regarding the relative difficulties of several types of problems and the potential effectiveness of a novel instructional approach. Perhaps the most general lesson of the findings is that the statistical distribution of problems that learners encounter can influence mathematics learning in powerful and nonintuitive ways. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.4318181818181818
Two mechanisms of sensorimotor set adaptation to inclined stance,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032021846&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00480&partnerID=40&md5=783a44aef69e683aa0433212347cdb16,"Orientation of posture relative to the environment depends on the contributions from the somatosensory, vestibular, and visual systems mixed in varying proportions to produce a sensorimotor set. Here, we probed the sensorimotor set composition using a postural adaptation task in which healthy adults stood on an inclined surface for 3 min. Upon returning to a horizontal surface, participants displayed a range of postural orientations – from an aftereffect that consisted of a large forward postural lean to an upright stance with little or no aftereffect. It has been hypothesized that the post-incline postural change depends on each individual’s sensorimotor set: whether the set was dominated by the somatosensory or vestibular system: Somatosensory dominance would cause the lean aftereffect whereas vestibular dominance should steer stance posture toward upright orientation. We investigated the individuals who displayed somatosensory dominance by manipulating their attention to spatial orientation. We introduced a distraction condition in which subjects concurrently performed a difficult arithmetic subtraction task. This manipulation altered the time course of their post-incline aftereffect. When not distracted, participants returned to upright stance within the 3-min period. However, they continued leaning forward when distracted. These results suggest that the mechanism of sensorimotor set adaptation to inclined stance comprises at least two components. The first component reflects the dominant contribution from the somatosensory system. Since the postural lean was observed among these subjects even when they were not distracted, it suggests that the aftereffect is difficult to overcome. The second component includes a covert attentional component which manifests as the dissipation of the aftereffect and the return of posture to upright orientation. © 2017 Lee, Baksh, Bryant, McGowan, McMillan and Chong.",0.39776951672862454
Encouraging top-down attention in visual search:A developmental perspective,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85024477298&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-017-1379-5&partnerID=40&md5=4d715aa8801539be6092929dd1975616,"Four experiments are reported in which 60 younger children (7–8 years old), 60 older children (10–11 years old), and 60 young adults (18–25 years old) performed a conjunctive visual search task (15 per group in each experiment). The number of distractors of each feature type was unbalanced across displays to evaluate participants’ ability to restrict search to the smaller subset of features. The use of top-down attention processes to restrict search was encouraged by providing external aids for identifying and maintaining attention on the smaller set. In Experiment 1, no external assistance was provided. In Experiment 2, precues and instructions were provided to focus attention on that subset. In Experiment 3, trials in which the smaller subset was represented by the same feature were presented in alternating blocks to eliminate the need to switch attention between features from trial to trial. In Experiment 4, consecutive blocks of the same subset features were presented in the first or second half of the experiment, providing additional consistency. All groups benefited from external support of top-down attention, although the pattern of improvement varied across experiments. The younger children benefited most from precues and instruction, using the subset search strategy when instructed. Furthermore, younger children benefited from blocking trials only when blocks of the same features did not alternate. Older participants benefited from the blocking of trials in both Experiments 3 and 4, but not from precues and instructions. Hence, our results revealed both malleability and limits of children’s top-down control of attention. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.44166666666666665
Social support and amphetamine-type stimulant use among female sex workers in China,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019586370&doi=10.1080%2f09540121.2017.1328101&partnerID=40&md5=e2ee5a11a9f74c4ab068f6a67099d81e,"Background: Existing research has suggested a positive role of social support in reducing drug use among female sex workers (FSWs). However, there is limited research on the role of social support in amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use among FSWs in China. This study explored the present situation of ATS use among FSWs in Guangxi, China and examined the associations of different types of social support from different sources with ATS use. Method: A sample of 1022 FSWs was recruited from 56 commercial sex venues in Guangxi Autonomous Region in China. Bivariate comparison was used to compare demographic characteristics and source of emotional or tangible social support across frequency of ATS use among FSWs. The relationship between social support and ATS use was examined using multiple ordinal logistic regression models controlling for the potential confounding effects of demographic variables. Results: The multiple ordinal logistic regression indicated that FSWs who were from younger age groups (aOR = 10.88 for age group <20; aOR = 2.80 for age group 20–23), and from all higher-income venues (aOR = 1.96 for venue level 1; aOR = 2.28 for venue level 2; aOR = 1.81 for venue level 3) tended to use ATS more frequently. They also tended to use ATS more frequently when they depended on their boyfriends (aOR = 1.08) for emotional support or on their co-workers for tangible support (aOR = 1.17). Conclusions: Different types of social support from different sources can be either positively or negatively associated with ATS use among FSWs, therefore, the future intervention efforts should differentiate and target different types and different sources of social support in response to the living and work conditions of FSWs. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.5057034220532319

Mutual influence of reward anticipation and emotion on brain activity during memory retrieval,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032272221&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01873&partnerID=40&md5=b217fd5b3cb891b71215ed06dcac43dc,"Previous studies on the joint effect of reward motivation and emotion on memory retrieval have obtained inconsistent results. Furthermore, whether and how any such joint effect might vary over time remains unclear too. Accordingly, using the event-related potential (ERP) measurement of high temporal resolution, our study investigates the cognitive and brain mechanisms of monetary reward and emotion affecting the retrieval processes of episodic memory. Twenty undergraduate and graduate students participated in the research, and our study's behavioral results indicated that reward (relative to no reward) and negative emotion (relative to positive and neutral emotion) significantly improved recognition performance. The ERP results showed that there were significant interactions between monetary reward and emotion on memory retrieval, and the reward effects of positive, neutral, and negative memory occurred at varied intervals in mean amplitude. The reward effect of positive memory appeared relatively early, at 260-330 ms after the stimulus onset in the frontal-frontocentral area, at 260-500 ms in the centroparietal-parietal area and at 500-700 ms in the frontocentral area. However, the reward effects of neutral and negative memory occurred relatively later, and that of negative memory appeared at 500-700 ms in the frontocentral and centroparietal area and that of neutral memory was at 500-700 ms in the frontocentral and centroparietal-parietal area. Meanwhile, significant FN400 old/new effects were observed in the negative and rewarded positive items, and the old/new effects of negative items appeared earlier at FN400 than positive items. Also, significant late positive component (LPC) old/new effects were found in the positive, negative, and rewarded neutral items. These results suggest that, monetary reward and negative emotion significantly improved recognition performance, and there was a mutual influence between reward and emotion on brain activity during memory retrieval. © 2017 Yan, Liu, Li, Zhang and Cui.",0.5614035087719298

One hundred and nineteen 3- to 6-year-old children and their parents participated. Parents filled in a questionnaire regarding children's television viewing time, television content and parental mediation behaviors about their child's television viewing. The children were asked to finish six EF tasks, including the backward digit span task, the spatial span task, the boy-girl Stroop, the Simon task, the flanker task and the Tower of Hanoi task that assessed working memory, inhibition and planning, respectively. Children's vocabulary was tested using Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and included as control variables in addition to socioeconomic status of the participated families. The results showed that television viewing time and child-directed educational programs were positively associated with EF. In addition, television content fully mediated the effect of television viewing time on EF and parental restrictive approach strategies moderated the effect of television viewing time on EF. © 2017 Yang, Chen, Wang and Zhu.",0.5

However, the body of knowledge on how the long-term career experience affects the brain's functional plasticity is still very limited. In this study, we used a dynamic functional connectome characterization (DBFCC) model with the automatic target generation process K-Means clustering to explore the functional reorganization property of resting brain states, driven by long-term career experience. Taking sailors as an example, DBFCC generated seventeen reproducibly common atomic connectome patterns (ACP) and one reproducibly distinct ACP, i.e., ACP14. The common ACPs indicating the same functional topology of the resting brain state transitions were shared by two control groups, while the distinct ACP, which mainly represented functional plasticity and only existed in the sailors, showed close relationships with the long-term career experience of sailors. More specifically, the distinct ACP14 of the sailors was made up of four specific sub-networks, such as the auditory network, visual network, executive control network, and vestibular function-related network, which were most likely linked to sailing experience, i.e., continuously suffering auditory noise, maintaining balance, locating one's position in three-dimensional space at sea, obeying orders, etc. Our results demonstrated DBFCC's effectiveness in revealing the specifically functional alterations modulated by sailing experience and particularly provided the evidence that functional plasticity was beneficial in reorganizing brain's functional topology, which could be driven by career experience. © 2017 Wang, Zeng, Shi and Yan.",0.45643153526970953

HK mothers endorsed the highest levels of psychological control and the lowest levels of autonomy support compared to BJ and LA mothers. Perceived social change as measured by mothers' endorsement of new values and ideologies was associated with increased use of both autonomy support and psychological control. Results of the mediation analyses suggested that perceived social change explained differences between LA and HK mothers in autonomy support, but group differences in psychological control were magnified when perceived social change was accounted for. Finally, whereas autonomy support was associated with higher levels of child perceived acceptance in HK and LA, psychological control was associated with greater family conflict in BJ and LA. Findings suggested that as families undergo urbanization or social change, it may shift the implications of traditional strategies that are intended to socialize the child toward interpersonal attunement. Overall, the study highlights the importance of moving beyond ethnic-group or cross-national comparisons to investigate the role of changing social and economic contexts in understanding differences in the use of parental control and their associations with family relations. © 2017 Fung, Kim, Jin, Wu, Fang and Lau.",0.5173913043478261

The influence of social category cues on the happy categorisation advantage was similar in the Australian and Chinese samples. In both samples, the happy categorisation advantage was present for own-race male faces when they were encountered with other-race male faces but reduced when own-race male faces were categorised along with female faces.

In reaction to a shrinking population, the Japanese government is encouraging more women to participate in the labor force. Actual success in achieving this aim, however, is limited. Specifically, participation in the workforce by women during their reproductive years is impacted by their health, which involves not only work conditions, but also traditional family circumstances. Therefore, it is important to further assess and gather more information about the health status of women who work during their reproductive years in Japan. Specifically, women's health can be represented by menstruation status, which is a pivotal indicator. In this study, we assessed the association between short rest periods in work intervals and menstruation and other health status indicators among female workers in Japan. Methods: Study participants were recruited from the alumnae of a university, which provided a uniform educational level. All 9864 female alumnae were asked to join the survey and 1630 (17%) accepted. The final sample of study participants (n = 505) were aged 23-43 years, had maintained the same job status for at least 1 year, and were not shift workers, had no maternal status, and did not lack any related information. The participants were divided into two groups according to interval time, with 11 h between end of work and resumption of daily work as a benchmark. This interval time was based on EU regulations and the goal set by the government of Japan. Health outcomes included: menstrual cycle, dysmenorrhoea symptoms, anxiety regarding health, and satisfaction in terms of health. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for health indexes in association with interval time by adjusting for confounding variables that included both psychosocial and biological factors. Results: We compared the health status of women in the workforce with and without a sufficient interval time of 11 h/day. Workers who had a short interval time had a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety about health and dissatisfaction with their health. For menstruation status, only abnormal menstruation cycles were observed more often among workers in the short interval group than those of the long interval group. However, this association disappeared when biological confounding factors were adjusted in a multivariable regression model. Dysmenorrhea symptoms did not show a statistically significant association with short interval time. Conclusions: This study found a significant association between a short interval time of less than 11 h/day and subjective health indicators and the menstrual health status of women in the workforce. Menstrual health was more affected by biological factors than social psychological factors. A long work time and short interval time could increase worker anxiety and dissatisfaction and may deteriorate the menstrual cycle. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.4260089686098655

Here, we investigated how the individual tendency to eudaimonic well-being relative to hedonic wellbeing, measured using eudaimonic and hedonic balance (EHB) index, is reflected in the functional and structural features of a key network of well-being-the default mode network (DMN). We found that EHB was positively correlated with functional connectivity of bilateral ventral medial prefrontal cortex within anterior DMN and bilateral precuneus within posterior DMN. Brain morphometric analysis showed that EHB was also positively correlated with gray matter volume in left precuneus. These results demonstrated that the relative dominance of one form of well-being to the other is reflected in the morphometric characteristics and intrinsic functions of DMN. © The Author (2017).",0.40476190476190477

A total of 54 undergraduates majoring in Chinese Language from a university in Hanoi, Vietnam, who had 1 year of learning experience in Chinese were assigned to two experimental groups that received instructional intervention, called ""old-for-new"" semantic radical teaching, through two counterbalanced sets of semantic radicals, with one control group. All of the students completed pre- and post-tests of a sentence cloze task where they were required to choose an appropriate character that fit the sentence context among four options. The four options shared the same phonetic radicals but had different semantic radicals. The results showed that the pre-test and post-test score increases were significant for the experimental groups, but not for the control group. Most importantly, the experimental groups successfully transferred the semantic radical strategy to figure out the meanings of unfamiliar characters containing semantic radicals that had not been taught. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of teaching semantic radicals for lexical inference in sentence reading for nonnative speakers, and highlight the ability of transfer learning to acquire semantic categories of sub-lexical units (semantic radicals) in Chinese characters among foreign language learners. © 2017 Nguyen, Zhang, Li, Wu and Cheng.",0.4782608695652174
Testing the nicotine dependence measure mFTQ for adolescent smokers: A multinational investigation,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023625425&doi=10.1111%2fajad.12583&partnerID=40&md5=309e15e6b015194fe733fa9edb2798da,"Background and Objectives: As a measure of nicotine dependence among adolescent smokers, the modified Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire (mFTQ; seven items), has been successfully used in the United States (USA). Nonetheless, the validity and reliability of mFTQ at the international level is still needed. The current study is the first to test the validity and reliability of mFTQ in four countries: Thailand, Spain, the USA, and Russia. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey, mFTQ, risk factors of nicotine dependence, and sociodemographic characteristics were assessed. Risk factors included age of first cigarette, frequency of alcohol use, frequency of marijuana use, and number of cigarettes smoked yesterday. Salivary cotinine was also obtained in Thailand and Spain. Results: For all four countries, mFTQ exhibited a single factor structure, as supported by previous work in the USA. For all studied countries except Thailand, mFTQ presented acceptable internal reliability. Overall, risk factors of nicotine dependence have predicted mFTQ scores across countries. Frequency of alcohol use in the USA and frequency of marijuana use in Thailand and Spain were not associated with mFTQ scores. Discussion and Conclusions: mFTQ is a single-factor measure of nicotine dependence that shows acceptable internal consistency and validity across countries. Further work can advance the scale and tailor it to different cultures. Scientific Significance: mFTQ can be a clinically practical international measure of nicotine dependence. This study provides initial support for the utility of the mFTQ among Thai, Spanish, American, and Russian adolescents. Further research is needed to test and advance mFTQ across cultures.

Frontal theta activity supports detecting mismatched information in visual working memory,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031495062&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01821&partnerID=40&md5=326a7713e1ee5ecfd0429a33597b3dd5,"During the comparison stage of visual working memory (VWM) processing, detecting the mismatch between the external sensory input and internal representations is a crucial cognitive ability for human, but the neural mechanism behind it remains largely unclear. The present study investigated the role of frontal theta power in detecting the mismatched information in VWM in a delayed matching task. A control task required to compare two simultaneously presented visual figures was also designed as a contrast to exclude the possibility that frontal theta activity just reflecting the non-memory-related behavioral conflicts. To better characterize the control mechanisms shaped by the frontal theta oscillation in human VWM, colored shapes were adopted as materials while both the task-relevant shape feature and task-irrelevant color feature could be mismatched. We found that the response times of participants were significantly delayed under the relevant- and irrelevant-mismatch conditions in both tasks and the conjunction-mismatch condition in delayed matching task. While our EEG data showed that increased frontal theta power was only observed under the relevant- and conjunction-mismatch conditions in the delayed matching task, but not the control task. These findings suggest that the frontal distributed theta activity observed here reflects the detection of mismatched information during the comparison stage of VWM, rather than the response-related conflicts. Furthermore, it is consistent with the proposal that theta-band oscillation can act as a control mechanism in working memory function so that the target-mismatched information in VWM could be successfully tracked. We also propose a possible processing structure to explain the neural dynamics underlying the mismatch detection process in VWM. © 2017 Liang, Hu and Liu.",0.4714828897338403

This study also documents the implications of these profiles for students’ engagement, disengagement, and achievement, and investigates the role of self-oriented perfectionism in predicting profile membership. A sample of 504 first-year undergraduates completed all measures twice across a two-month period. Latent profile analysis and latent transition analysis revealed six distinct motivation profiles, which proved identical across measurement points. Membership into the Autonomous, Strongly Motivated, Poorly Motivated, and Controlled profiles was very stable over time, while membership into the Moderately Autonomous and Moderately Unmotivated profiles was moderately stable. Self-oriented perfectionism predicted a higher likelihood of membership into the Autonomous and Strongly Motivated profiles, and a lower likelihood of membership into the Controlled profile. The Autonomous, Strongly Motivated, and Moderately Autonomous profiles were associated with the most positive outcomes, while the Poorly Motivated and Controlled profiles were associated with the most negative outcomes. Of particular interest, the combination of high autonomous motivation and high controlled motivation (Strongly Motivated profile) was associated with positive outcomes, which showed that autonomous motivation was able to buffer even high levels of controlled motivation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.44651162790697674

Based on this, adopting the ecological MEs recognition paradigm, this study aimed to comparatively evaluate facial ME recognition in depressed and healthy individuals. The findings of the study are as follows: (1) background expression: the accuracy (ACC) in the neutral background condition tended to be higher than that in the fear background condition, and the reaction time (RT) in the neutral background condition was significantly longer than that in other backgrounds. The type of ME and its interaction with the type of background expression could affect participants’ ecological MEs recognition ACC and speed. Depression type: there was no significant difference between the ecological MEs recognition ACC of patients with depression and healthy individuals, but the patients’ RT was significantly longer than that of healthy individuals; and (2) patients with depression judged happy MEs that were presented against different backgrounds as neutral and judged neutral MEs that were presented against sad backgrounds as sad. The present study suggested the following: (1) ecological MEs recognition was influenced by background expressions. The ACC of happy MEs was the highest, of neutral ME moderate and of sadness and fear the lowest. The response to the happy MEs was significantly shorter than that of identifying other MEs. It is necessary to conduct research on ecological MEs recognition; (2) the speed of patients with depression in identifying ecological MEs was slower than of healthy individuals; indicating that the patients’ cognitive function was impaired; and (3) the patients with depression showed negative bias in the ecological MEs recognition task, reflecting the lack of happy ME recognition ability and the generalized identification of sad MEs in those patients. © 2017 Zhu, Chen, Zhang, Liu, Tang, Xu, Zhang and Liu.",0.3762057877813505
Self-referential information alleviates retrieval inhibition of directed forgetting effects—an ERP evidence of source memory,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041956052&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00187&partnerID=40&md5=2ebb8948320bf4d605f74bf0d8faa0be,"Directed forgetting (DF) assists in preventing outdated information from interfering with cognitive processing. Previous studies pointed that self-referential items alleviated DF effects due to the elaboration of encoding processes. However, the retrieval mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Based on the dual-process framework of recognition, the retrieval of self-referential information was involved in familiarity and recollection. Using source memory tasks combined with event-related potential (ERP) recording, our research investigated the retrieval processes of alleviative DF effects elicited by self-referential information. The FN400 (frontal negativity at 400 ms) is a frontal potential at 300–500 ms related to familiarity and the late positive complex (LPC) is a later parietal potential at 500–800 ms related to recollection. The FN400 effects of source memory suggested that familiarity processes were promoted by self-referential effects without the modulation of to-be-forgotten (TBF) instruction. The ERP results of DF effects were involved with LPCs of source memory, which indexed retrieval processing of recollection. The other-referential source memory of TBF instruction caused the absence of LPC effects, while the self-referential source memory of TBF instruction still elicited the significant LPC effects. Therefore, our neural findings suggested that self-referential processing improved both familiarity and recollection. Furthermore, the self-referential processing advantage which was caused by the autobiographical retrieval alleviated retrieval inhibition of DF, supporting that the self-referential source memory alleviated DF effects. © 2017 Mao, Wang, Wu and Guo.",0.43946188340807174
Visually Evoked Visual-Auditory Changes Associated with Auditory Performance in Children with Cochlear Implants,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076536947&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00510&partnerID=40&md5=6177763d1d9530380ec292b94687928f,"Activation of the auditory cortex by visual stimuli has been reported in deaf children. In cochlear implant (CI) patients, a residual, more intense cortical activation in the frontotemporal areas in response to photo stimuli was found to be positively associated with poor auditory performance. Our study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which visual processing in CI users activates the auditory-associated cortex during the period after cochlear implantation as well as its relation to CI outcomes. Twenty prelingually deaf children with CI were recruited. Ten children were good CI performers (GCP) and ten were poor (PCP). Ten age- and sex- matched normal-hearing children were recruited as controls, and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded. The characteristics of the right frontotemporal N1 component were analyzed. In the prelingually deaf children, higher N1 amplitude was observed compared to normal controls. While the GCP group showed significant decreases in N1 amplitude, and source analysis showed the most significant decrease in brain activity was observed in the primary visual cortex (PVC), with a downward trend in the primary auditory cortex (PAC) activity, but these did not occur in the PCP group. Meanwhile, higher PVC activation (comparing to controls) before CI use (0M) and a significant decrease in source energy after CI use were found to be related to good CI outcomes. In the GCP group, source energy decreased in the visual-auditory cortex with CI use. However, no significant cerebral hemispheric dominance was found. We supposed that intra- or cross-modal reorganization and higher PVC activation in prelingually deaf children may reflect a stronger potential ability of cortical plasticity. Brain activity evolution appears to be related to CI auditory outcomes. © Copyright © 2017 Liang, Zhang, Liu, Chen, Cai, Wang, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Li, Chen and Zheng.",0.3854166666666667
The different roles of category- and feature-specific attentional control settings on attentional enhancement and inhibition,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85022005815&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-017-1363-0&partnerID=40&md5=c7accff62f7f92c86b30b1ff633ac341,"Contingent attentional capture suggests that top-down attentional control settings (ACS) can enhance attentional processing of task-relevant properties and inhibit attentional processing of task-irrelevant properties. However, it remains unclear how ACS operates when a distractor has both task-relevant and task-irrelevant characteristics. In the present study, two lateralized ERP components, N2pc and distractor positivity (Pd), were employed as markers of attentional enhancement and inhibition, respectively. The degree of matching between a distractor and a conjunctively defined target was manipulated to illustrate attentional guidance by category-specific ACS (cACS) and feature-specific ACS (fACS), and the relative position between the distractor and the target was manipulated to isolate the processing of the distractor and the target. Experiment 1 showed that, with a long display duration for searching, a reliable N2pc component was elicited by a distractor that was feature-matched but category-mismatched (C-F+) relative to the target-defined properties, suggesting an enhancing effect of fACS. In contrast, Experiment 2 demonstrated that, with a short display duration, a Pd component was elicited by a distractor that was feature-mismatched but category-matched (C+F-) relative to the target-defined properties, suggesting an inhibitory effect of fACS. Moreover, both attentional enhancement and inhibition were only triggered by fACS but not by cACS. In summary, ACS can enhance target-relevant properties or inhibit target-irrelevant properties in response to the display duration, and fACS affects both enhancement and inhibition more than cACS. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.42105263157894735
The relation between maternal work hours and primary school students' affect in China: The role of the frequency of mother-child communication (FMCC) and maternal education,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049222093&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01777&partnerID=40&md5=e202248f9bca38ecf11ead6ae426e322,"Background: Although substantial evidence suggests that maternal work hours may have a negative effect on children's cognitive development, the link between maternal work hours and children's affect remains unclear. Some studies have observed that non-daytime maternal work hours are associated with more emotional problems among children. However, few studies have focused on the effects of maternal work hours on workdays and non-workdays. Therefore, this study separately investigated the relation between maternal work hours on workdays and on non-workdays and explored the mediating role of the frequency of mother-child communication (FMCC) and the moderating role of maternal education. Method: Using cluster sampling, this study selected 879 students in grades 4-6 at two primary schools in the Hebei and Shandong provinces in China and their mothers as the study subjects. A multi-group structural equation model (SEM) was used to test the relations between maternal work hours, FMCC and children's affect and the moderating effect of maternal education. Results: (1) Non-college-educated mothers' work hours on workdays negatively predicted FMCC, but there was no such effect for college-educated mothers; (2) non-workday work hours of all employed mothers negatively predicted FMCC; (3) the FMCC of all employed mothers positively predicted children's positive affect; (4) the FMCC of college-educated mothers negatively predicted children's negative affect although there was no such relation for non-college-educated mothers; (5) there was a significant mediating effect of FMCC on the relation between maternal work hours and children's affect only for non-college-educated mothers; and (6) the workday work hours of non-college-educated mothers positively predicted children's negative affect, but this correlation was negative for college-educated mothers. Conclusion: Maternal work hours have a marginally significant negative effect on children's affect through FMCC only for non-college-educated mothers. Compared with non-college-educated mothers, college-educated mothers more easily compensate for the loss of communication opportunities caused by increased work hours on workdays, and children with college-educated mothers benefit more from this communication. However, compensating for the loss of communication opportunities caused by increased work hours on non-workdays is difficult for all employed mothers. © 2017 Zhou, Lv, Guo, Liu, Qi, Hu, Liu and Luo.",0.49107142857142855

We examined the assimilation effect of eye shadow on complexion using two series of eye shadows: typical colors that are not evenly saturated and colors with saturation as even as possible. Twenty participants assessed the degree of redness in reddish faces, yellowness in yellowish faces, and lightness in both faces via paired comparisons. The results indicated that: (a) the reddish face was perceived as redder when it had eye shadow of pinkish and purplish colors or reddish saturated colors instead of containing yellowish components; (b) the yellowish face became less yellow with colors without a greenish or yellowish component; and (c) except for the lighter yellowish shade, eye shadow made the face perceptually darker. We confirmed the assimilation effect of eye shadow on complexion and showed differences in perceptual hue change according to the original face colors. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

Sixty-four subjects were randomly recruited, separated into different groups and tested with 42 pairs of pictures depicting moral violations. Each subject was required to rate the pictures two separate times, i.e., before and after tDCS intervention. We found that anodal tDCS (atDCS) increases cortical excitability over the mPFC (between the Fpz and Fp1 positions) as well as the sense of morality and emotional arousal of the subjects.

Two hundred and six college students filled in the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and completed emotional ratings and moral judgment on moral vignettes from Moral Foundations Vignettes. Correlation analysis indicated that habitual cognitive reappraisal was negatively related to immorality rating in Harm, Fairness, and Loyalty domains. Regression analysis revealed that after controlling the effect of other variables, cognitive reappraisal negatively predicted immorality ratings in the Harm and Fairness domains. Further mediation analysis showed that emotional valence only partially explained the association between cognitive reappraisal and moral judgment in Harm area.

"Economic growth, income inequality and environment: assessing the applicability of the Kuznets hypotheses to Asia",2017,48,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056209148&doi=10.1057%2fpalcomms.2017.69&partnerID=40&md5=bc6ac35e61fb346a06c8542bd4040bd9,"In light of growing threats to sustainable development, two serious challenges (that is, rising income inequality and environmental degradation) have been addressed by numerous empirical studies. However, the results of those surveys undertaken for varied samples over different time periods have in many cases turned out inconclusive regarding the validity of the two Kuznets related hypotheses that dealt with the challenges. Hence, the two hypotheses are tested in our study for the case of Asia with a view to exploring the interlink between the hypotheses, as there seems to be a limited literature on this issue, especially on Asia. The Kuznets inverted U-curve hypothesis that posits the relationship between income and income inequality has met varying degrees of acceptance. The recent work by Piketty, for example, refuted the hypotheses as irrelevant as the universally applicable theory, though Piketty himself has not dealt with in-depth analysis of Asia, the region that has had the largest increase in income inequality in the developing world since the 1990s. As for the second hypothesis (EKC curve) that postulates the relationship between income and environmental deterioration, diverse results produced by multitudinous surveys need to be re-examined by further studies, especially on Asia, the region that includes three of the world’s top five largest GHG emissions resultant from the highest economic growth rate achieved since 1990. Our cross-country and non-econometric analysis of 20 Asian countries shows that the Kuznets inverted U-curve hypothesis is valid with some limitations. Both Asian trends in income inequality and in environmental degradation (CO2 emissions) appear, by and large, to follow Kuznets’ hypothesized curve up to the lower level of high income as income rises, whereas a divergent trend could be observed among high income economies, generating a second inverted U-curve with frequent irregularities in the trend curve as income increases. Irregularities in the curves that are frequently observed among high income economies seem to be apparently generated by country-specific conditions, policy, technology and so on. Thus growth impacts on income inequality and environmental deterioration differ substantially among the high income economies, whereas among the countries with lower income, growth impacts generated on inequality are generally small, though their impacts on environment tend to be large. While environmental and income policy is often non-existent for low income countries, high income countries have generally introduced varied policies to cope with growing income inequality and environmental degradation. Since irregular patterns in the two Kuznets inverted U-curves seem to be generated by country-specific conditions and policies, that appear to be wide-ranging among economies within higher income range, econometric analyses that have produced divergent results on the validity of Kuznetsian hypothesis may need to be supplemented by different approaches that take in to account country-specific conditions. This study raises the question whether it is possible to promote equitable income growth that could reconcile with environmental protection. The governments of high income countries, the largest emitters of all income groups, may need to cope with the issue by devising policies that seek a proper link between development and environment. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.40039840637450197

One distinct feature of cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) is that they assume the latent trait to be discrete instead of continuous as in IRT. From this perspective, cognitive diagnosis bears a close resemblance to searching problems in computer science and, similarly, item selection problem in cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) can be considered as a dynamic searching problem. Previously, item selection algorithms in CD-CAT were developed from information indices in information science and attempted to achieve a balance among several objectives by assigning different weights. As a result, they suffered from low efficiency from a tug-of-war competition among multiple goals in item selection and, at the same time, put an undue responsibility of assigning the weights for these goals by trial and error on users. Based on the searching problem perspective on CD-CAT, this article adapts the binary searching algorithm, one of the most well-known searching algorithms in searching problems, to item selection in CD-CAT. The two new methods, the stratified dynamic binary searching (SDBS) algorithm for fixed-length CD-CAT and the dynamic binary searching (DBS) algorithm for variable-length CD-CAT, can achieve multiple goals without any of the aforementioned issues. The simulation studies indicate their performances are comparable or superior to the previous methods. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4336283185840708

Recently, the interest in this phenomenon has been extended from elementary number processing to mental arithmetic. Many studies have demonstrated horizontal spatial-arithmetic associations, i.e., solving addition or subtraction problems cause spatial shifts of attention rightward or leftward, respectively. However, the role of this effect in the vertical dimension has not been addressed. This is problematic because it leaves the analogy between elementary number processing and arithmetic incomplete. In order to make a strong case for a similarity between elementary number processing and mental arithmetic, a spatial-arithmetic association should be observed in the vertical dimension too. Here, we adopted the target detection paradigm from Liu et al. (2017) to replicate the horizontal spatial-arithmetic association, and meanwhile investigate whether this effect also exists in the vertical direction. Our results confirmed that addition could induce covert movement to right side and subtraction to left side. However, such a spatial-arithmetic association was not found in the vertical dimension.

The purpose of the study was to explore the neural basis of humor comprehension, particularly the moment of insight, by using both characters and language-free cartoons in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. The results showed that insight involving jokes elicited greater activation in language and semantic-related brain regions as well as a variety of additional regions, such as the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the temporoparietal junctions (TPJ), the hippocampus and visual areas. These findings indicate that the MTG might play a role in incongruity detection, while the SFG, IFG and the TPJ might be involved in incongruity detection. The passive insight event elicited by jokes appears to be mediated by a limited number of brain areas. Our study showed that the brain regions associated with humor comprehension were not affected by the type of stimuli and that humor and insight shared common brain areas. These results indicate that one experiences a feeling of insight during humor comprehension, which contributes to the understanding of humor comprehension. © 2017 Tian, Hou, Zhu, Dietrich, Zhang, Yang, Chen, Sun, Jiang and Cao.",0.41232227488151657

However, neither the discrete slot-based theory or continuous resource theory clearly stipulates how the mental commodity for VWM (discrete slot or continuous resource) is allocated. Allocation may be based on the number of items via stimulus-driven factors, or it may be based on task demands via voluntary control. Previous studies have obtained conflicting results regarding the automaticity versus controllability of such allocation. In the current study, we propose a two-phase allocation model, in which the mental commodity could be allocated only by stimulus-driven factors in the early consolidation phase. However, when there is sufficient time to complete the early phase, allocation can enter the late consolidation phase, where it can be flexibly and voluntarily controlled according to task demands. In an orientation recall task, we instructed participants to store either fewer items at high-precision or more items at low-precision. In 3 experiments, we systematically manipulated memory set size and exposure duration. We did not find an effect of task demands when the set size was high and exposure duration was short. However, when we either decreased the set size or increased the exposure duration, we found a trade-off between the number and precision of VWM representations. These results can be explained by a two-phase model, which can also account for previous conflicting findings in the literature. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.48132780082987553

"Self-Referent and Other-Referent Career Successes, Career Satisfaction, and Turnover Intention Among Chinese Employees: The Role of Achievement Motivation",2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028648306&doi=10.1177%2f0894845316657181&partnerID=40&md5=3743aca77bf2212cf6edf5fa8c4ce4be,"Based on the social comparison theory, this research examined how self-referent and other-referent career successes predict career satisfaction and turnover intention among a sample of Chinese employees (N = 299). It was found that both self-referent and other-referent career successes played unique roles in predicting career satisfaction, which, in turn, predicted turnover intention. In addition, this research examined the role of achievement motivation in this process and revealed a moderated mediation model for the relations among these variables. Specifically, the indirect effect of self-referent career success on turnover intention through career satisfaction was stronger among employees with a higher level of individual-orientated achievement motivation, and the indirect effect of other-referent career success on turnover intention through career satisfaction was stronger among employees with a lower level of individual-orientated achievement motivation. These findings carry implications for research on career success and turnover intention. © 2016, © Curators of the University of Missouri 2016.",0.5273972602739726

One hundred and eighty undergraduate students participated in a vignette experiment. They read four scenarios describing daily intergroup conflict situations, and rated behavioral intention for ingroup cooperation and frequency-dependent tendency of ingroup members. In each vignette, level of intergroup conflict (weak/moderate) was manipulated by costs of defeat. The results supported the hypothesis in part that intergroup conflict enhanced both ingroup cooperation and conformity. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

A cross-national comparison of violence among young men in China and the UK: psychiatric and cultural explanations,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027376667&doi=10.1007%2fs00127-017-1420-y&partnerID=40&md5=2185500bc91c614bf370ae52a5be47a7,"Purpose: Public health psychiatry has a key role in violence prevention. Cross-national comparisons of violence and associated psychiatric morbidity can indicate targets for preventive interventions. Method: Data on young adult men in households, 18–34 years, were drawn from the Second Men’s Modern Lifestyles survey in Great Britain (n = 2046) and from a corresponding survey in Chengdu, China (n = 4132), using a translated questionnaire. Binary logistic regression models were carried out to estimate the cross-national differences for different types of violence and to identify explanatory variables. Results: Chinese men were less likely to report violence in the past 5 years (AOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.48–0.72, P < 0.001). All levels of violence were lower among Chinese men except intimate partner violence (AOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.65–3.59, P < 0.001) and a higher proportion of Chinese men were only violent towards their partners (AOR 7.90, 95% CI 3.27–19.07, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Cross-national differences were explained by British men’s reports of early violence persisting into adulthood, confidence in fighting ability, perception that violence is acceptable behaviour, and experience of violent victimization. More British men screened positive for antisocial personality disorder and substance misuse. Attitudes which condone violence and a serious problem of alcohol-related, male-on-male violence are key targets for preventive interventions among British men. The higher prevalence of life course-persistent antisocial behaviour among British men is of concern and requires further investigation. Higher prevalence of intimate partner violence among Chinese men reflects patriarchal approaches to conflict resolution and confirms an important public health problem in China which requires further cross-national investigation. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.4834710743801653

Currently publicly available Korean corpora are limited by the fact that they only provide orthographic representations in Hangeul, which is problematic since phonetic forms in Korean cannot be reliably predicted from orthographic forms. We describe the method used to derive the surface phonetic forms from a publicly available orthographic corpus of Korean, and report on several statistics calculated using this database; namely, segment unigram frequencies, which are compared to previously reported results, along with segment-based and syllable-based neighborhood density statistics for three types of representation: an “orthographic” form, which is a quasi-phonological representation, a “conservative” form, which maintains all known contrasts, and a “modern” form, which represents the pronunciation of contemporary Seoul Korean. These representations are rendered in an ASCII-encoded scheme, which allows users to query the corpus without having to read Korean orthography, and permits the calculation of a wide range of phonological measures. © 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.3699421965317919
The “social” facilitation of eating without the presence of others: Self-reflection on eating makes food taste better and people eat more,2017,39,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019626840&doi=10.1016%2fj.physbeh.2017.05.022&partnerID=40&md5=2b83c8ec79ccd3f38b95122fcfd41174,"Food tastes better and people eat more of it when eaten with company than alone. Although several explanations have been proposed for this social facilitation of eating, they share the basic assumption that this phenomenon is achieved by the existence of co-eating others. Here, we demonstrate a similar “social” facilitation of eating in the absence of other individuals. Elderly participants tasted a piece of popcorn alone while in front of a mirror (which reflects the participant themselves eating popcorn) or in front of a wall-reflecting monitor, and were found to eat more popcorn and rate it better tasting in the self-reflecting condition than in the monitor condition. Similar results were found for younger adults. The results suggest that the social facilitation of eating does not necessarily require the presence of another individual. Furthermore, we observed a similar “social” facilitation of eating even when participants ate a piece of popcorn in front of a static picture of themselves eating, suggesting that static visual information of “someone” eating food is sufficient to produce the “social” facilitation of eating. © 2017 The Authors",0.42134831460674155

Moreover, we investigated how the reputation or location of the university affected face recognition performance using an old/new paradigm. We assigned five different university labels to the faces: participants' own university and four other universities. Among the four other university labels, we manipulated the academic reputation and geographical location of these universities relative to the participants' own university. The results showed that an own-group face recognition bias emerged for faces with own-university labels comparing to those with other-university labels. Furthermore, we found a robust own-group face recognition bias only when the other university was located in a different city far away from participants' own university. Interestingly, we failed to find the influence of university reputation on own-group face recognition bias. These results suggest that categorizing a face as a member of one's own university is sufficient to enhance recognition accuracy and the location will play a more important role in the effect of social categorization on face recognition than reputation. The results provide insight into the role of motivational factors underlying the university membership in face perception. © 2017 Yan, Wang, Huang, Sun, Judges, Xiao and Lee.",0.4975609756097561
Who are likely to attempt suicide again? A comparative study between the first and multiple timers,2017,30,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029292763&doi=10.1016%2fj.comppsych.2017.07.007&partnerID=40&md5=bff8e50fdb971bb5d50bd59179183eae,"Background Various explanations account for suicide incidents, and some patients continue to attempt afterwards and others never again. The suicide mortality rate increases with the number of serious attempts. The prevention of secondary attempt of suicide should be an important approach to reduce suicide mortality. However, the characteristics of the targeted population of repeated suicide attempters are understudied. Methods This was a cross-sectional data collection from hospital emergency room from patients who had either attempted suicide for the first time (n = 721) or for two or more times (n = 70). The subjects were between 14 and 53 years old and comprised 293 males and 498 females. In-depth interview was conducted for each suicide attempter with a semi-structural protocol. Demographic and social-psychological characteristics were compared between the two groups of suicide attempters. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of multiple attempts. Findings The two groups only differed in religion factor among demographic characteristics and multiple suicide attempters group have a higher percentage of subjects who reported to have a religion affiliation than first time suicide attempters. Multiple attempters were more likely to have family suicide history, physical illness, mental disorder, higher scores on Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) and lower scores on Duke Social Support Scale (DSSI). In the final regression model, family history of suicide, mental disorder, hopelessness and social support emerged as significant predictors of multiple suicide attempts. Conclusion Suicide attempters that have mental disorder, family history of suicide, higher level of hopelessness and lower level of social support are more likely to re-attempt suicide again. Social and clinical interventions may have to also focus on this sub-group of patients with these characteristics to effectively reduce suicide mortality rate. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.5354609929078015
Neural entrainment to auditory imagery of rhythms,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032006681&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00493&partnerID=40&md5=53a2a23aac42baecab7a8327d5d47e12,"A method of reconstructing perceived or imagined music by analyzing brain activity has not yet been established. As a first step toward developing such a method, we aimed to reconstruct the imagery of rhythm, which is one element of music. It has been reported that a periodic electroencephalogram (EEG) response is elicited while a human imagines a binary or ternary meter on a musical beat. However, it is not clear whether or not brain activity synchronizes with fully imagined beat and meter without auditory stimuli. To investigate neural entrainment to imagined rhythm during auditory imagery of beat and meter, we recorded EEG while nine participants (eight males and one female) imagined three types of rhythm without auditory stimuli but with visual timing, and then we analyzed the amplitude spectra of the EEG. We also recorded EEG while the participants only gazed at the visual timing as a control condition to confirm the visual effect. Furthermore, we derived features of the EEG using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and conducted an experiment to individually classify the three types of imagined rhythm from the EEG. The results showed that classification accuracies exceeded the chance level in all participants. These results suggest that auditory imagery of meter elicits a periodic EEG response that changes at the imagined beat and meter frequency even in the fully imagined conditions. This study represents the first step toward the realization of a method for reconstructing the imagined music from brain activity. © 2017 Okawa, Suefusa and Tanaka.",0.4817813765182186
The intergenerational transmission of at-risk/problem gambling: The moderating role of parenting practices,2017,25,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028911314&doi=10.1111%2fajad.12599&partnerID=40&md5=af4bd2be78c6ae97d4d66830a0f69c34,"Background and Objectives: Although parenting practices are articulated as underlying mechanisms or protective factors in several theoretical models, their role in the intergenerational transmission of gambling problems has received limited research attention. This study therefore examined the degree to which parenting practices (positive parenting, parental involvement, and inconsistent discipline) moderated the intergenerational transmission of paternal and maternal problem gambling. Methods: Students aged 12–18 years (N = 612) recruited from 17 Australian secondary schools completed a survey measuring parental problem gambling, problem gambling severity, and parenting practices. Results: Participants endorsing paternal problem gambling (23.3%) were 4.3 times more likely to be classified as at-risk/problem gamblers than their peers (5.4%). Participants endorsing maternal problem gambling (6.9%) were no more likely than their peers (4.0%) to be classified as at-risk/problem gamblers. Paternal problem gambling was a significant predictor of offspring at-risk/problem gambling after controlling for maternal problem gambling and participant demographic characteristics. The relationship between maternal problem gambling and offspring at-risk/problem gambling was buffered by parental involvement. Discussion and Conclusions: Paternal problem gambling may be important in the development of adolescent at-risk/problem gambling behaviours and higher levels of parental involvement buffers the influence of maternal problem gambling in the development of offspring gambling problems. Further research is therefore required to identify factors that attenuate the seemingly greater risk of transmission associated with paternal gambling problems. Scientific Significance: Parental involvement is a potential candidate for prevention and intervention efforts designed to reduce the intergenerational transmission of gambling problems.

Regulation of the industry is state- and territory-based, with eight jurisdictions enacting purpose-built legislation. Training was a key area of reform in the 1990s and early 2000s, but standards remained fragmented until 2008 when the Committee of Australian Governments agreed on a national competency framework to be implemented by 2010. However, despite the adoption of a common curriculum for core security tasks, the project derailed spectacularly in terms of consistency of standards, as revealed by a number of major inquiries and associated sources. This article analyses the reasons for this situation and recommends an alternative model to optimise competency standards in security work that includes much greater specificity in hours of instruction and in teaching and assessment methods. The lessons from this study have wider application given that deficits in security training appear to be a common problem internationally. © 2017 School of Criminal Justice, Michigan State University.",0.5

The present research is based on the hypothesis that using Hugvie maintains users' level of trust toward their conversation partners in situations prone to suspicion. The level of trust felt toward other remote game players was compared between participants using Hugvie and those using a basic communication device while playing a modified version of Werewolf, a conversation-based game, designed to evaluate trust. Although there are always winners and losers in the regular version of Werewolf, the rules were modified to generate a possible scenario in which no enemy was present among the players and all players would win if they trusted each other. We examined the effect of using Hugvie while playing Werewolf on players' level of trust toward each other and our results demonstrated that in those using Hugvie, the level of trust toward other players was maintained. © 2017 Takahashi, Ban, Osawa, Nakanishi, Sumioka and Ishiguro.",0.3737864077669903

The current study first investigated whether East Asians also have a similar pattern by recruiting Chinese participants and using social-evaluative threat manipulations in which participants perform self-evaluation tasks while adopting different social-evaluative feedbacks (Experiment 1). Then further examined whether the different response patterns can be modulated by different types of self-construal by using social-evaluative threat manipulations in conjunction with a self-construal priming task (Experiment 2). The results showed that, as opposed to Westerners' pattern, Chinese participants rated themselves as having significantly greater above-average effect only when faced with the nonthreatening feedback but not the social-evaluative threat. More importantly, we found that self-construal modulated the self-evaluation under social-evaluative threat: following independent self-construal priming, participants tended to show a greater above-average effect when faced with a social-evaluative threat. However, this pattern in conjunction with a social threat disappeared after participants received interdependent self-construal priming or neutral priming. These findings suggest that the effects of social-evaluative threat on self-evaluation are not culturally universal and is strongly modulated by self-construal priming. © 2017 Zhang, Xi, Jin and Wu.",0.42328042328042326

This question has been debated for decades. We noted that the change of objects in scenes might simultaneously be accompanied with gist changes. In the present study we aimed to examine how the alteration of gist, as well as the consistency of the changed objects, modulated change detection. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the semantic content by either keeping or changing the consistency of the scene. Results showed that the changes of consistent and inconsistent scenes were equally detected. More importantly, the changes were more accurately detected when scene consistency changed than when the consistency remained unchanged, regardless of the consistency of the memory scenes. A phase-scrambled version of stimuli was adopted in Experiment 2 to decouple the possible confounding effect of low-level factors. The results of Experiment 2 demonstrated that the effect found in Experiment 1 was indeed due to the change of high-level semantic consistency rather than the change of low-level physical features. Together, the study suggests that the change of consistency plays an important role in scene short-term memory, which might be attributed to the sensitivity to the change of semantic content. © 2017 Gong, Xuan, Xu and Fu.",0.4504950495049505

A total of 325 preschool children between the ages of 34 and 57 months (M = 4 years 2 months) and their parents participated in the study. Fathers and mothers, respectively, reported their levels of psychological control and mothers evaluated the socioemotional development of children using two indicators (i.e., behavioral problems and prosocial behaviors). The results indicated that the relative predictive effects of maternal and paternal psychological control on children's socioemotional development differed. Specifically, maternal psychological control was a significant predictor of children's behavioral problems and prosocial behaviors, whereas the levels of paternal psychological control were unrelated to children's socioemotional development. With regard to the combined effects of maternal and paternal psychological control, the results of ANOVAs and simple slope analysis both indicated that children would be at risk of behavioral problems as long as they had one highly psychologically controlling parent. High levels of paternal psychological control were associated with increased behavioral problems of children only when maternal psychological control was low. However, the association between maternal psychological control and children's behavioral behaviors was significant, despite paternal psychological control. © 2017 Xing, Gao, Song, Archer, Zhao, Zhang, Ding and Liu.",0.49261083743842365

Complex sociocultural interactions emerging in these dyadic interviews included guilt, shame, unintended disclosure, the need for secrecy, perceived stigma, ‘loss of face’, protection of parents, inability to support their families and deep concerns over lineage and future marriage prospects amongst the parents, which had significant psychosocial and even physical impacts for these adolescents born with HIV and their families. Frontline health-care workers and HIV peer support programs are recommended to counteract China’s current top-down biomedical disease-related approach to health services.

Using amethod of hyperscanning electroencephalography (EEG), which simultaneously measures brain activity among interacting subjects, we further illustrate that interbrain synchrony of gamma band oscillations is enhanced when people are under high threat, and increased gamma interbrain synchrony is associated with lower dyadic interpersonal time lag (i.e. higher coordination) (Experiment 2). To our knowledge, the current work provides some of the first empirical evidence that gamma interbrain synchrony is associated with social coordination when humans are under threat. © The Author (2017).",0.43037974683544306
Dual temporal scale convolutional neural network for micro-expression recognition,2017,133,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031401405&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01745&partnerID=40&md5=7437b14610cb0a29f2ac47bd9c625e28,"Facial micro-expression is a brief involuntary facial movement and can reveal the genuine emotion that people try to conceal. Traditional methods of spontaneous micro-expression recognition rely excessively on sophisticated hand-crafted feature design and the recognition rate is not high enough for its practical application. In this paper, we proposed a Dual Temporal Scale Convolutional Neural Network (DTSCNN) for spontaneous micro-expressions recognition. The DTSCNN is a two-stream network. Different of stream of DTSCNN is used to adapt to different frame rate of micro-expression video clips. Each stream of DSTCNN consists of independent shallow network for avoiding the overfitting problem. Meanwhile, we fed the networks with optical-flow sequences to ensure that the shallow networks can further acquire higher-level features. Experimental results on spontaneous micro-expression databases (CASME I/II) showed that our method can achieve a recognition rate almost 10% higher than what some state-of-the-art method can achieve. © 2017 Peng, Wang, Chen, Liu and Fu.",0.40939597315436244
The effect of testosterone administration and digit ratio (2D:4D) on implicit preference for status goods in healthy males,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041956921&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00193&partnerID=40&md5=80f5749239860eafa3afde24d13a8f9a,"Testosterone has been linked to social status seeking in humans. The present study investigated the effects of testosterone administration on implicit and explicit preferences for status goods in healthy male participants (n = 64), using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design. We also investigated the interactive effect between second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D; i.e., a proximal index of prenatal testosterone) and testosterone treatment on status preferences. Results showed that testosterone administration has no discernable influence on self-reported willingness-to-pay (i.e., the explicit measure) or implicit attitudes towards status goods. Individuals with lower 2D:4D (i.e., more masculine) had more positive attitudes for high-status goods on an Implicit Association Task, and this association was abolished with testosterone administration. These data suggest interactive effects of acute testosterone administration and prenatal testosterone exposure on human social status seeking, and highlight the utility of implicit methods for measuring status-related behavior. © 2017 Wu, Zilioli, Eisenegger, Clark and Li.",0.4657534246575342
"The relationship of sleep complaints risk factors with sleep phase, quality, and quantity in Japanese workers",2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029762996&doi=10.1007%2fs41105-017-0110-1&partnerID=40&md5=6a32e6c484694db8f4ce4ef3a062bac2,"Numerous studies have determined that lifestyle factors (smoking, drinking, snacking, etc.) and the bedroom environment can influence sleep. We developed a new sleep scale—the 3-Dimensional Sleep Scale (3DSS)—which measures three elements of sleep: phase, quality, and quantity. The purpose of this study is to determine which risk factors of sleep complaints are associated with these sleep elements. Data were obtained from 366 Japanese day workers (302 men and 64 women). Sleep condition was assessed with the 3DSS, and we also assessed various habits within 2 h of going to bed, including smoking, drinking, snacking, caffeine intake, mobile phone use, and working. We also asked about bedroom environmental conditions (noise, lighting, and temperature and humidity). Multivariate logistic regression analysis using the backward selection method (likelihood ratio) was used, with 3DSS scores as the outcome (i.e., over or under the cutoff). The results showed that smoking was associated with significantly greater odds ratio [2.71 (1.65–4.44)] of disordered sleep phase, while lighting as well as temperature and humidity led to greater odds [3.67 (1.55–8.68), 1.93 (1.20–3.11)] of poor sleep quality. Finally, only noise was significantly related to greater odds [1.98 (1.13–3.46)] of low sleep quantity. These findings indicated the various risk factors of sleep complaints could be associated with different sleep elements. This might help in the effective treatment of sleep complaints. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.4019138755980861
Impact of a new medical network system on the efficiency of treatment for eating disorders in Japan: A retrospective observational study,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030246064&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0113-9&partnerID=40&md5=77c2af1723d06158cca9a9a7daaf9c57,"Background: In Japan, patients generally have free access to any hospital or clinic. This could lead to reduced efficiency in the treatment for eating disorders (EDs) because there are only a limited number of doctors who can treat ED patients. The objectives of this study were to examine the efficiency of a new trial system for consultation and appointments, a medical community network (MCN), in outpatient treatment for EDs. MCN schedules appointments for the first visit only by referral from another medical institution, not by patients themselves. Methods: We analyzed the data of 342 outpatients (mean age=28.9±9.9years; 328 female and 14 male) who visited the ED clinic at the University of Tokyo Hospital for the first time between January 2009 and July 2012 to investigate possible differences in treatment efficacy between the new (MCN+) system and the conventional (MCN-) system, which accepts reservations directly from patients. Results: The no-show rate for MCN+ patients (0.8%) was significantly lower than that for the MCN- group (17.8%) (p<0.001). MCN+ patients had a significantly shorter waiting period (8.4days) for the first visit compared to MCN- patients (35.5days, p<0.001). In addition, the MCN+ group had a much higher rate of successive visits to the clinic (p<0.05). Conclusion: This new consultation system using a medical community network provided more efficient treatment for ED than did the appointment system in which the patients made their appointments by themselves. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.46017699115044247
Do alternating-color words facilitate reading aloud text in Chinese?

This issue is particularly important for those writing systems that do not employ interword spaces (e.g., Chinese). The rationale is that alternating colors across words in these scripts may facilitate the process of word identification without altering the spatial distribution of text. Here, we tested whether color alternation across words produces a benefit in a reading-aloud task in native speakers of Chinese. Participants had to read two texts: one with color alternation across words and the other with mono-color words. Experiments 1 and 2 were conducted with adult readers, whereas Experiment 3 was conducted with developing readers (Grade 2 children). Results showed that color information facilitated reading aloud a text for adult readers—restricted to texts containing technical, unfamiliar words (Experiment 2)—and developing readers. We examined the implications of these findings in the context of literacy and vocabulary training. © 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4339622641509434

Here, we conducted a systematic, quantitative meta-analysis of functional-MRI studies intranasally administering OT (IN-OT) to uncover neural substrates underlying the IN-OT effects and to elucidate differential IN-OT effects between healthy and clinical populations. Meta-analyses were conducted on 66 IN-OT fMRI studies, stratified by psychopathology, valence and sex. IN-OT increased bilateral amygdala, caudate head, and superior temporal activity in healthy individuals and increased dorsal anterior cingulate activity in patients. Moreover, IN-OT decreased amygdala activity in both patients and healthy individuals but did so to a greater degree in patients than healthy individuals. The OT-increased amygdala activity was only found on the negative social and affective processes, whereas the OT-decreased amygdala activity was mainly contributed by contrasts on negative-valenced processes. IN-OT increased parahippocampal activity and decreased amygdala activity during negative socio-affective processing. During positive socio-affective processes, IN-OT increased caudate head activity. This study indicates convergent neural substrates and the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms for IN-OT effects on social and affective processes. The common and different effects of IN-OT on patients and healthy individuals and the modulation of OT effects by valence have critical implications. © The Author (2017).",0.485

Aims: In this regard and because of the need to develop a harmonious and peaceful world, the present study aimed at constructing a peace pedagogy model which could foster a culture of peace in any educational institution. To elaborate, we describe the implementation process of a peace model in a school environment. For appropriateness, a qualitative approach with a case study method was used. 35 students were taken as the participants of the study, chosen from the eleventh grade of the science class of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia’s demonstration High School, plus 7 teachers were taken from Indonesian Language, History, Civic Education, Islamic Education, Arts, Guidance and Counseling, and Biology departments. All the participants were purposively selected as informants to the study. Conclusion: The model was demonstrated in 14 class sessions of 40 minutes each spread across the seven mentioned school subjects. Data were analysed thematically and triangulated based on theoretical comparison and personal reflection. Conclusively, it was etablished that the model’s implementation had no significant effect on the creation of a safe and peaceful classroom environment based on the zone of peace parameters. It was finally revealed that their weaknesses regarding the model’s construction, teachers’ knowledge about the model, differences in teachers’ abilities, challenges in classroom management and inadquate student support activities. © 2017 Setiadi et al.",0.4769874476987448

Some patients develop psychiatric issues, such as depressive, obsessive-compulsive, or psychotic-like disorders, in their late adolescence or young adulthood. Furthermore, these individuals may experience moderate to severe emotional and psychological distress. Development of a psychosocial treatment to address these issues is needed in addition to psychotropic medication. The current study reports two cases of young adults with Down syndrome, who presented psychiatric symptoms and marked disruption in their daily lives. These individuals participated in a Dohsa-hou treatment program. Following treatment, adaptive levels, maladaptive behaviors, and internalizing problems were evaluated by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II. Participants showed improvement in maladaptive behaviors and internalizing problems; however, improvement in these areas may be influenced by baseline severity of the problems. This case report suggests that Dohsa-hou could be an effective therapeutic approach for maladaptive and internalizing problems in adults with Down syndrome. © 2017 Fujino.",0.44025157232704404

Participants (N = 174) were randomly allocated to the three conditions. Variables of interest were gambling outcome and related mental health measures. Participants in the active conditions (I-CBT and I-MFS) completed six online modules. Both I-CBT and I-MFS conditions resulted in significant treatment gains on gambling severity. However, I-CBT was also associated with reductions in a range of other gambling-related and mental health outcomes. Compared with I-MFS, I-CBT produced greater effects across seven outcomes measures, relating to gambling urges, cognitions, stress, and life satisfaction. I-CBT participants also rated the program as significantly more satisfactory. Treatment gains observed for both active conditions were found to be stable through to 12 month follow up. The results indicate that the benefits of I-CBT were more than simply the non-specific effects of engaging in online treatment or receiving motivation, feedback, and support.

Selective fair behavior as a function of psychopathic traits in a subclinical population,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029703277&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01604&partnerID=40&md5=41acf112cd8e8b792f291c520d17bfbf,"Psychopathy is a group of personality traits that are associated with violations of social norms. Previous studies have suggested that people with psychopathic traits in subclinical populations do not necessarily display antisocial, self-defeating behaviors, and instead may strategically show adaptive behaviors in response to cues during reciprocal social interactions. Therefore, in the present study, we examined whether the association between psychopathic traits and unfair behavior can be moderated by a potential for punishment and social distance (anonymity), which are known to facilitate fair behavior. We focused on two psychopathic traits: primary and secondary psychopathy. Primary psychopathy is characterized by callousness, shallow affect, manipulation, and superficial charm. In contrast, secondary psychopathy is associated with impulsivity and lack of long-term goals, and is related to hostile behavior. A total of 348 undergraduate students determined the amounts of money that they would offer to strangers or friends at their university in hypothetical scenarios of the ultimatum game (UG) and the dictator game (DG). While gender affected decisions in the hypothetical scenarios of the DG, it did not interact with psychopathic traits. The score for primary psychopathy on the Levenson self-report psychopathy scale predicted unfair monetary offers to strangers in the DG, where participants could not be punished. However, compared with their offers in the DG, individuals with higher scores for primary psychopathy made larger offers in the UG, where low offers could trigger punishment from the recipient. Moreover, primary psychopathy did not decrease the amounts of offers in either game when the participant considered the recipient to be a friend. On the other hand, secondary psychopathy was not associated with differences in behavioral fairness depending on a potential for punishment or social distance. Based on these findings, we discuss strategic social skills as a function of primary psychopathy. © 2017 Osumi and Ohira.",0.3939393939393939

Our understanding of the role of the dorsal pathway, in particular, has greatly evolved within the framework of the two-pathway hypothesis since its original conception. Here, we present a comparative review of the primate dorsal pathway in humans and monkeys based on electrophysiological, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and neuroanatomical studies. We consider similarities and differences across species in terms of the topographic representation of visual space; specificity for eye, reaching, or grasping movements; multi-modal response properties; and the representation of objects and tools. We also review the relative anatomical location of functionally- and topographically-defined regions of the posterior parietal cortex. An emerging theme from this comparative analysis is that non-spatial information is represented to a greater degree, and with increased complexity, in the human dorsal visual system. We propose that non-spatial information in the primate parietal cortex contributes to the perception-to-action system aimed at manipulating objects in peripersonal space. In humans, this network has expanded in multiple ways, including the development of a dorsal object vision system mirroring the complexity of the ventral stream, the integration of object information with parietal working memory systems, and the emergence of tool-specific object representations in the anterior intraparietal sulcus and regions of the inferior parietal lobe. We propose that these evolutionary changes have enabled the emergence of human-specific behaviors, such as the sophisticated use of tools. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.4573643410852713

Processes indicative of a self-positivity bias are reflected in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals at ~400 ms when the task does not require a discrimination of self from other.However,whendistinguishingbetweenself-referentialandother-referential emotions is required, previous studies have shown inconsistent temporal dynamics of EEG signals in slightly different tasks. Based on the observation of early self–other discrimination, we hypothesized that self would be rapidly activated in the early stage to modulate emotional processing in the late stage during an implicit self-referential emotion. To test this hypo thesis, we employed an implicit task in which participants were asked to judge the order of Chinese characters of trait adjectives preceded by a self (“I”) or other pronoun (“He” or “She”). This study aimed to explore the difference of social-related emotional evaluation from self-reference; the other pronoun was not defined to a specific person, rather it referred to the general concept. Sixteen healthy Chinese subjects participated in the experiment. Event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that there were self-other discrimination effects in the N1 (80–110 ms) and P1 (170–200 ms) components in the anterior brain. The emotional valence was discriminated in the later component of N2 (220–250 ms). The interaction between self-reference and emotional valence occurred during the late positive potential (LPP; 400–500 ms). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between response time (RT) andN1in the self-reference condition based on the positive-negative contrast, suggestinga modulatory effect of the self-positivity bias. The results indicate that self-reference emerges earlier than emotion and then combines with emotional processing in an implicit task. The findings extend the view that the self plays a highly integrated and modulated role in self-referential emotion processing. © 2017 Zhou, Guo, Ma, Zhang, Liu, Feng, Yang, Wang, Wang and Zhong.",0.32525951557093424

When humans engage in imitation/IPS behaviors, multiple regions in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices are activated including the putative Mirror Neuron Systems (Iacoboni, 2005; Buxbaum et al., 2014). In the present study, we compared fNIRS-based cortical activation patterns across three conditions of action observation (“Watch” partner), action execution (“Do” on your own), and IPS (move “Together”). Methods: Fifteen typically developing adults completed a reach and cleanup task with the right arm while cortical activation was examined using a 24-channel, Hitachi fNIRS system. Each adult completed 8 trials across three conditions (Watch, Do, and Together). For each fNIRS channel, we obtained oxy hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxy hemoglobin (HHb) profiles. Spatial registration methods were applied to localize the cortical regions underneath each channel and to define six regions of interest (ROIs), right and left supero-anterior (SA or pre/post-central gyri), infero-posterior (IP or angular/supramarginal gyri), and infero-anterior (IA or superior/middle temporal gyri) regions. Results: In terms of task-related differences, the majority of the ROIs were more active during Do and Together compared to Watch. Only the right/ipsilateral fronto-parietal and inferior parietal cortices had greater activation during Together compared to Do. Conclusions: The similarities in cortical activation between action execution and IPS suggest that neural control of IPS is more similar to its execution than observational aspects. To be clear, the more complex the actions performed, the more difficult the IPS behaviors. Secondly, IPS behaviors required slightly more right-sided activation (vs. execution/observation) suggesting that IPS is a higher-order process involving more bilateral activation compared to its sub-components. These findings provide a neuroimaging framework to study imitation and IPS impairments in special populations such as infants at risk for and children with ASD. © 2017 Bhat, Hoffman, Trost, Culotta, Eilbott, Tsuzuki and Pelphrey.",0.4360655737704918

It is possible that neural pathways of amusia patients on a larger scale are affected. In this study, we investigated changes in structural connections by applying both tract-based and network-based analysis to DTI data of 12 subjects with congenital amusia and 20 demographic-matched normal controls. TBSS (tract-based spatial statistics) was used to detect microstructural changes. The results showed that amusics had higher diffusivity indices in the corpus callosum, the right inferior/superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the right inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). The axial diffusivity values of the right IFOF were negatively correlated with musical scores in the amusia group. Network-based analysis showed that the efficiency of the brain network was reduced in amusics. The impairments of WM tracts were also found to be correlated with reduced network efficiency in amusics. This suggests that impaired WM tracts may lead to the reduced network efficiency seen in amusics. Our findings suggest that congenital amusia is a disconnection syndrome. © 2017 Wang, Zhang, Wan and Peng.",0.34705882352941175

These features correspond to Skinner’s three-term contingency consisting of a stimulus, a response, and a consequence. In a typical operant experiment, the operandum is used to measure a response topography that the animal emits easily and the baseline level of which is high enough to be conditioned as operant response, for example, lever pressing for rats and key pecking for pigeons. Because those responses can be detected using a microswitch, a human observer is not required to detect the response. However, the natural response repertoire of animals is not limited to such contact responses with the operandum. Many researchers have developed various automated experimental systems designed to detect responses other than contact responses with the operanda, for example, locomotion, turning responses, and vocalization. Recent technologies make it possible to detect responses such as these latter ones in real time without a human observer. The present paper provides a developmental history of how the components of the Skinner box have been modified to detect response topographies other than contact responding to a particular operandum. © 2017, Sociedad Mexicana de Analisis de la Conducta.

To address the causal role of oscillatory activity in modulating cortico-cortical signal transmission, we have established a new method using concurrent tACS, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). Through tACS, we introduced 6-Hz (theta) oscillatory activity in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). During tACS, we applied single-pulse TMS over the DLPFC at different phases of tACS and assessed propagation of TMS-induced neural activity with EEG.We show that tACS-induced theta oscillations modulate the propagation of TMS-induced activity in a phase-dependent manner and that phase-dependent modulation is not simply explained by the instantaneous amplitude of tACS. The results demonstrate a phase-dependent modulatory mechanism of tACS at a cortical network level, which is consistent with a causal role of neural oscillations in regulating the efficacy of signal transmission in the brain. © 2017 Fehér, Nakataki and Morishima.",0.41450777202072536
The presentation location of the reference stimuli affects the left-side bias in the processing of faces and Chinese characters,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030172788&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01673&partnerID=40&md5=8f7f4bb06bff204e00e7abe0e46c5679,"For faces and Chinese characters, a left-side processing bias, in which observers rely more heavily on information conveyed by the left side of stimuli than the right side of stimuli, has been frequently reported in previous studies. However, it remains unclear whether this left-side bias effect is modulated by the reference stimuli's location. The present study adopted the chimeric stimuli task to investigate the influence of the presentation location of the reference stimuli on the left-side bias in face and Chinese character processing. The results demonstrated that when a reference face was presented in the left visual field of its chimeric images, which are centrally presented, the participants showed a preference higher than the no-bias threshold for the left chimeric face; this effect, however, was not observed in the right visual field. This finding indicates that the left-side bias effect in face processing is stronger when the reference face is in the left visual field. In contrast, the left-side bias was observed in Chinese character processing when the reference Chinese character was presented in either the left or right visual field. Together, these findings suggest that although faces and Chinese characters both have a left-side processing bias, the underlying neural mechanisms of this left-side bias might be different. © 2017 Li and Cao.",0.4265402843601896
Multiple attentional sets while monitoring rapid serial visual presentations,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991035987&doi=10.1080%2f17470218.2016.1231827&partnerID=40&md5=d82a439dc188a5ddb70c4309eda3f801,"The present study examined whether observers are able to establish multiple attentional sets to concurrently monitor two different spatial locations. Observers identified a target letter in red or cyan among nontarget letters of other heterogeneous colours during a temporal feature search. A peripheral distractor display consisted of one item of either the same colour as the current target, and the other potential target colour, or an irrelevant colour that could never be the target. They identified an odd-ball colour letter among homogenous colours during a singleton search. The results revealed that observers maintained multiple attentional sets for detecting two singletons or for targets involving two (or three) features. However, they were unable to maintain a mixture of sets. Moreover, exposure to a distractor containing feature that corresponded to a feature of the current target was advantageous for target identification. The presence or absence of this set-specific capture depended on top-down knowledge and did not occur automatically in the singleton-detection stream. These results demonstrate a limitation in the flexibility of attentional sets. Although two singleton detections were possible, multiple attentional templates for a more complex attentional set could not be maintained concurrently when monitoring multiple rapid serial visual presentations. © 2016 The Experimental Psychology Society.",0.4306930693069307
A combination of outcome and process feedback enhances performance in simulations of child sexual abuse interviews using avatars,2017,23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029218507&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01474&partnerID=40&md5=b45220efc44ddec6faf990cc960222a4,"Simulated interviews in alleged child sexual abuse (CSA) cases with computer-generated avatars paired with feedback improve interview quality. In the current study, we aimed to understand better the effect of different types of feedback in this context. Feedback was divided into feedback regarding conclusions about what happened to the avatar (outcome feedback) and feedback regarding the appropriateness of question-types used by the interviewer (process feedback). Forty-eight participants each interviewed four different avatars. Participants were divided into four groups (no feedback, outcome feedback, process feedback, and a combination of both feedback types). Compared to the control group, interview quality was generally improved in all the feedback groups on all outcome variables included. Combined feedback produced the strongest effect on increasing recommended questions and correct conclusions. For relevant and neutral details elicited by the interviewers, no statistically significant differences were found between feedback types. For wrong details, the combination of feedback produced the strongest effect, but this did not differ from the other two feedback groups. Nevertheless, process feedback produced a better result compared to outcome feedback. The present study replicated previous findings regarding the effect of feedback in improving interview quality, and provided new knowledge on feedback characteristics that maximize training effects. A combination of process and outcome feedback showed the strongest effect in enhancing training in simulated CSA interviews. Further research is, however, needed. © 2017 Pompedda, Antfolk, Zappalà and Santtila.",0.43231441048034935

Recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) studies show that cortical activity is concurrently entrained/synchronized to the rhythms of multiple levels of linguistic units including words, phrases, and sentences. Here we investigate whether this phenomenon can be observed using electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that is more widely available than MEG and ECoG. We show that the EEG responses concurrently track the rhythms of hierarchical linguistic units such as syllables/words, phrases, and sentences. The strength of the sentential-rate response correlates with how well each subject can detect random words embedded in a sequence of sentences. In contrast, only a syllabic-rate response is observed for an unintelligible control stimulus. In sum, EEG provides a useful tool to characterize neural encoding of hierarchical linguistic units, potentially even in individual participants. © 2017 Ding, Melloni, Yang, Wang, Zhang and Poeppel.",0.34459459459459457

Thus, the external source fails to realize the individuals' need for feedback, and the feedback environment cannot provide them with useful information, leading to a feedback vacuum. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of feedback-seeking by different strategies on the supervisor-feedback environment through supervisor identification. The article consists of an empirical study with a sample of 264 employees in China; here, participants complete a series of questionnaires in three waves.

How upward moral comparison influences prosocial behavioral intention: Examining the mediating role of guilt and the moderating role of moral identity,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029720444&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01554&partnerID=40&md5=634654f0a3d3a9d49d41a46e606a877c,"Although it has been shown that exceptional good deeds exert influences on people's prosocial behavior and intention, we have known little about how common moral actions in our daily life. The present study aimed to examine how upward moral comparison influenced prosocial behavioral intention as well as to explore the mediating role of guilt and the moderating role of moral identity in the focal relationship. An experimental study was conducted with 162 Chinese undergraduates (103 women,59 men) randomly assigned to an upward moral comparison condition, an upward competence comparison condition or a control condition. Results indicated that participants in the upward moral comparison condition experienced higher levels of guilt and exhibited stronger motivation to act prosocially, relative to participants in the other two conditions. That is to say, upward moral comparison induces guilty experience, and then increases people's prosocial behavioral intention. Moreover, we have found that moral identity internalization moderates the upward moral comparison-guilt relationship, and the indirect effect of upward moral comparison on prosocial behavioral intention via guilt.

Cumulative evidence has revealed that individuals with schizotypy, as well as schizophrenia patients, have emotional processing deficits. In the present study, we investigated multimodal emotion perception in schizotypy and implemented the machine learning technique to find out whether a schizotypy group (ST) is distinguishable from a control group (NC), using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Forty-five subjects (30 ST and 15 NC) were divided into two groups based on their scores on a Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. All participants performed an audiovisual emotion perception test while EEG was recorded. After the preprocessing stage, the discriminatory features were extracted using a mean subsampling technique. For an accurate estimation of covariance matrices, the shrinkage linear discriminant algorithm was used. The classification attained over 98% accuracy and zero rate of false-positive results. This method may have important clinical implications in discriminating those among the general population who have a subtle risk for schizotypy, requiring intervention in advance. © 2017 Jeong, Wendimagegn, Chang, Chun, Park, Kim and Kim.",0.4124293785310734

The findings indicated that (1) although both older and younger adults recorded events related to both emotional and knowledge-acquisition goals, the odds ratio for reporting a higher number of events related to emotional goals compared to the number of events related to knowledge-acquisition goals was 2.12 times higher in older adults than that observed in younger adults. (2) Considering the number of events, there was an age-related positivity effect only for knowledge-related goals, and (3) older adults' ratings for events related to emotional and knowledge-acquisition goals were significantly more positive compared to those observed in younger adults.

In this study, we examined whether changes in orientation could be detected automatically under unattended condition. Visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) was used to analyze this processing. In addition, we investigated the underlying neural oscillatory activity. Non-phase-locked spectral power was used to explore the specific frequency related to unexpected changes in orientation. The experiment consisted of standard (0° arrows) and deviant (90° /270° arrows) stimuli. Compared with standard stimuli, deviant stimuli elicited a larger N170 component (negative wave approximately 170 ms after the stimuli started) and a smaller P2 component (positive wave approximately 200 ms after the stimuli started). Furthermore, vMMN was obtained by subtracting the event-related potential (ERP) waveforms in response to standard stimuli from those elicited in response to deviant stimuli. According to the time–frequency analysis, deviant stimuli elicited enhanced band power compared with standard stimuli in the delta and theta bands. Compared with previous studies, we concluded that theta activity plays an important role in the generation of the vMMN induced by changes in orientation. © 2017 Yan, Feng, Liu, Wang, Mu, Dong, Liu, Qin, Tang and Zhao.",0.39037433155080214

Based on the Dweck's social-cognitive theory of motivation, we further examined the moderating effect of students' theories of intelligence (TOIs) on this relationship. A total of 4036 (2066 girls) students from five public high school enrolled in grades 10 reported their high school entrance exam achievement in Chinese, Math and English, school engagement, and TOIs. Results showed that (a) students' prior achievement predicted their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, respectively, and (b) the association between prior achievement and behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement is strong for students with an incremental theory but not for those with an entity theory in the emotional and cognitive engagement. These findings suggest that prior achievement and incremental theory were implicated in relation to adolescents' school engagement.

However, it remains unclear whether similar effects can be achieved in expert-unfamiliar domains, especially within the context of implied motion. To answer this question, we conducted two independent experiments using an implied motion paradigm and examined the expert effects of badminton training on RM in both adult and child players. In Experiment 1, we used a cross-sectional design and compared RM between adult professional badminton players and matched controls. The results revealed significantly enhanced RM for adult players, supporting the expert effect in expert-unfamiliar domains for implied motion. However, cross-sectional studies could not ascertain whether the observed expert effect was due to innate factors or expertise acquirement. Therefore, in Experiment 2, we used a longitudinal design and compared RM between two groups of child participants, naming child players who had enrolled professional badminton training program at a sports school and age-matched peer non-players who attended an ordinary primary school without sports training. Before training, there were no differences in RM among child players, their non-player peers, and adult non-players. However, after 4 years of badminton training, child players demonstrated significantly enhanced RM compared to themselves prior to training. The increased RM observed in both adult and child players suggests that badminton expertise modulates implied motion RM. © 2017 Jin, Wang, Fang, Di, Ye, Xu, Lin, Cheng, Li, Xu and Rao.",0.3958333333333333

However, the majority of male employees actually wish to take paternity leave if they were to have a child. Previous studies have demonstrated that the organizational climate in workplaces is the major determinant of male employees' use of family-friendly policies, because males are often stigmatized and fear receiving negative evaluation from others. While such normative pressure might be derived from prevailing social practices relevant to people's expectation of social roles (e.g., ""Men make houses, women make homes""), these social practices are often perpetuated even after the majority of group members have ceased to support them. The perpetuation of this unpopular norm could be caused by the social psychological phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance. While researches have explored people's beliefs about gender roles from various perspectives, profound understanding of these beliefs regarding gender role norms, and the accuracy of others' beliefs remains to be attained. The current research examined the association between pluralistic ignorance and the perpetually low rates of taking paternity leave in Japan. Specifically, Study 1 (n = 299) examined Japanese male employees' (ages ranging from the 20 s to the 40 s) attitudes toward paternity leave and to estimate attitudes of other men of the same age, as well as behavioral intentions (i.e., desire and willingness) to take paternity leave if they had a child in the future. The results demonstrated that male employees overestimated other men's negative attitudes toward paternity leave. Moreover, those who had positive attitudes toward taking leave and attributed negative attitudes to others were less willing to take paternity leave than were those who had positive attitudes and believed others shared those attitudes, although there was no significant difference between their desires to take paternity leave. Study 2 (n = 425) replicated these results and further indicated that they could not be explained by the participants' needs to be socially desirable. Together, our findings suggest that pluralistic ignorance occurs in the context of taking paternity leave in Japanese men, and this leads to the low use of available paternity leave. © 2017 Miyajima and Yamaguchi.",0.4034582132564842

Unfortunately, there are very few works considering sparse versions of the classic factor analysis. Our goal is to contribute further in this direction. We revisit the most popular procedures for exploratory factor analysis, maximum likelihood and least squares. Sparse factor loadings are obtained for them by, first, adopting a special reparameterization and, second, by introducing additional ℓ1-norm penalties into the standard factor analysis problems. As a result, we propose sparse versions of the major factor analysis procedures. We illustrate the developed algorithms on well-known psychometric problems.

A desirable BCI system should be portable, minimally invasive, and feature high classification accuracy and efficiency. As two commonly used non-invasive brain imaging modalities, Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) BCI system have often been incorporated in the development of hybrid BCI systems, largely due to their complimentary properties. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the early temporal information extracted from singular EEG and fNIRS channels on each hemisphere can be used to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of a hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI system. Eleven healthy volunteers were recruited and underwent simultaneous EEG-fNIRS recording during a motor execution task that included left and right hand movements. Singular EEG and fNIRS channels corresponding to the motor cortices of each hemisphere were selected using a general linear model. Early temporal information was extracted from the EEG channel (0-1 s) along with initial hemodynamic dip information from fNIRS (0-2 s) for classification using a support vector machine (SVM). Results demonstrated a lofty classification accuracy using aminimal number of channels and features derived fromearly temporal information. In conclusion, a hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI system can achieve higher classification accuracy (91.02 ± 4.08%) and efficiency by integrating their complimentary properties, compared to using EEG (85.64 ± 7.4%) or fNIRS alone (85.55 ± 10.72%).

In three studies, we addressed this question by adopting a novel VPT task with motion stimuli and exploring the aftereffect on motion discrimination from the self-perspective. Overall the results showed a facilitation aftereffect when participants were instructed to take the avatar's perspective. Meanwhile, participants' self-reported perspective-taking tendencies correlated with the aftereffect for both instructed and spontaneous VPT tasks, when the ""to-be-adopted"" perspective required the participants to mentally transform their self-body clockwise. Specifically, while facilitation was induced for participants with low self-reported perspective-taking tendencies (e.g., viewing a leftward motion stimulus under another's perspective enhanced subsequent perception of leftward motion from the self-perspective), those with high self-reported perspective-taking tendencies showed an adaptation aftereffect (e.g., viewing a leftward motion stimulus under another's perspective weakened subsequent perception of leftward motion from the self-perspective). For these individuals, the adaptation effect indicated the engagement of direction-selective neurons in processing of the subsequent congruent-direction motion from self's perspective. These findings suggest that motion perception from different perspectives (self vs. another) may share the same direction-selective neural circuitry, and this possibility depends on observers' general perspective-taking tendencies. © 2017 Yuan, Wang, Geng and Zhang.",0.3926940639269406

Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have studied the neural mechanisms underlying bistable perception through univariate and multivariate pattern analyses; however, no studies have investigated the issue of category selectivity. Here, we used fMRI to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the Rubin face-vase illusion by introducing univariate amplitude and multivariate pattern analyses. The results from the amplitude analysis suggested that the activity in the fusiform face area was likely related to the subjective face perception. Furthermore, the pattern analysis results showed that the early visual cortex (EVC) and the face-selective cortex could discriminate the activity patterns of the face and vase perceptions. However, further analysis of the activity patterns showed that only the face-selective cortex contains the face information. These findings indicated that although the EVC and face-selective cortex activities could discriminate the visual information, only the activity and activity pattern in the face-selective areas contained the category information of face perception in the Rubin face-vase illusion. © 2017 Wang, Sang, Hao, Zhang, Bi and Qiu.",0.4791666666666667

Straightening the eyes doesn’t rebalance the brain,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032018983&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00453&partnerID=40&md5=9973963c7587802913b97227ea35341d,"Surgery to align the two eyes is commonly used in treating strabismus. However, the role of strabismic surgery on patients’ binocular visual processing is not yet fully understood. In this study, we asked two questions: (1) Does realigning the eyes by strabismic surgery produce an immediate benefit to patients’ sensory eye balance? (2) If not, is there a subsequent period of “alignment adaptation” akin to refractive adaptation where sensory benefits to binocular function accrue? Seventeen patients with strabismus (mean age: 17.06 ± 5.16 years old) participated in our experiment. All participants had normal or corrected to normal visual acuity (LogMAR < 0.10) in the two eyes. We quantitatively measured their sensory eye balance before and after surgery using a binocular phase combination paradigm. For the seven patients whose sensory eye balance was measured before surgery, we found no significant change [t(6) = −0.92; p = 0.39] in the sensory eye balance measured 0.5–1 months after the surgery, indicating that the surgical re-alignment didn’t by itself produce any immediate benefit for sensory eye balance. To answer the second question, we measured 16 patients’ sensory eye balance at around 5–12 months after their eyes had been surgically re-aligned and compared this with our measurements 0.5–1 months after surgery. We found no significant change [t(15) =−0.89; p=0.39] in sensory eye balance 5–12months after the surgery. These results suggest that strabismic surgery while being necessary is not itself sufficient for re-establishing balanced sensory eye dominance. © 2017 Zhou, Wang, Feng, Wang and Hess.",0.4588744588744589
Theta and alpha oscillations during the retention period of working memory by rTMS stimulating the parietal lobe,2017,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041949651&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00170&partnerID=40&md5=203b91f2bdfda798056a939bc4e3f9d1,"Studies on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have shown that stimulating the parietal lobe, which plays a role in memory storage, can enhance performance during the “retention” process of working memory (WM). However, the mechanism of rTMS effect during this phase is still unclear. In this study, we stimulated the superior parietal lobe (SPL) using 5-Hz rTMS in 26 participants and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while they performed a delayed-recognition WM task. The analyses included the comparisons of event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) value variations in theta (4–7 Hz) and alpha (8–14 Hz) band frequencies between conditions (rTMS vs. sham), as well as the correlations between different brain areas. Following rTMS, the ERSP values of theta-band oscillations were significantly increased in the parietal and occipital-parietal brain areas (P < 0.05∗ ), whereas the ERSP values of alpha-band oscillations were significantly decreased in the parietal area (P < 0.05∗ ). The ERSP value variations of theta-band oscillations between the two conditions in the left parietal and left prefrontal areas were positively correlated with the response time (RT) variations (by using rTMS, the more subject RT decreased, the more ERSP value of theta oscillation increased). The ERSP value variations of alpha-band oscillations in the left parietal and bilateral prefrontal areas were negatively correlated with RT variations (by using rTMS, the more RT of the subject decreased, the more ERSP value of alpha oscillation decreased). Inter-sites phase synchronization of theta-band EEG between the left parietal and left prefrontal areas, as well as alpha-band EEG between the left parietal and bilateral prefrontal areas were enhanced by rTMS. These results indicated that activities of both parietal and prefrontal areas were required for information storage, and these activities were related to the behavioral responses. Moreover, the connectivity between these two regions was intensified following rTMS. Thus, rTMS may affect the frontal area indirectly via the frontal parietal pathway. © 2017 Li, Jin, Wang, Qi, Liu and Yin.",0.37987012987012986

Practice of environmentally significant behaviours in rural China: From being motivated by economic gains to being motivated by environmental considerations,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047011683&doi=10.3390%2fbs7030059&partnerID=40&md5=88cbf8fadcc2fa3fbbf4a5aec8d4f0bd,"A continuous and increasing crisis that present-day China is facing is environmental degradation. The cultivation of citizens who have environmentally friendly behaviours has been deemed as a fundamental way to solve environmental crises. However, the main focus of environmentalism studies has been urban residents, whereas rare research attention was put on rural Chinese. This paper focuses on environmentally significant behaviours in rural China and aims to clarify the practice of five environmentally significant behaviours and two motivations underlying these behaviours. In total, 508 rural residents in 51 villages of Ningyang county were interviewed. Analytical results derived from survey data showed that environmentally significant behaviours are widely conducted in rural areas. However, these behaviours are mainly motivated by economic gains rather than environmental considerations. In addition, based on the norm-activation theory and considering the influences of demographic factors, the formation of environmentally motivated behaviours were quantitatively analysed. Analytical results indicated that the more people worried about environmental deterioration, the more likely they were to form environmentally motivated behaviours, and people who ascribe the most important environmental responsibility to the government are less likely to form environmentally motivated behaviours. Increasing people's anxiety towards the environment, decreasing people's dependency on the government in protecting the environment, and using females, the elderly, and people with low income and education levels as the main targets of environmental education are suggested to promote environmentally motivated behaviours in rural China. © 2017 by the authors.

However, few studies investigated the changes of global brain networks during the resting state in young smokers by EEG. In the present study, we used minimum spanning tree (MST) to assess the differences of global network efficiency between young smoker (n = 20) and nonsmokers (n = 20). Compared with healthy nonsmokers, young smokers showed decreased leaf fraction, kappa value, increased diameter and eccentricity value in alpha band (r = 0.574, p = 0.008), which suggested the global network efficiency was decreased in young smokers. We also found positive correlation between leaf fraction and onset time of smoking in smokers. These results provided more scientific evidence of the abnormal neural oscillations of young smokers and improved our understanding of smoking addiction. © 2017 Su, Yu, Cheng, Chen, Zhang, Guan, Li, Bi, Xue, Lu and Yuan.",0.381294964028777
Rumination as a mediator between childhood trauma and adulthood depression/anxiety in non-clinical participants,2017,46,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029791239&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01597&partnerID=40&md5=f57427bd5249c5c9bfabc5023717a391,"Objective: Although there is strong evidence that childhood trauma is associated with the development of depression and anxiety, relatively few studies have explored potential mediating factors for this relationship. The present study aimed to evaluate the mediating role of rumination in the link between childhood trauma and mood status such as depression, anxiety and affective lability. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and seven non-clinical participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Ruminative Response Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the Affective Lability Scale. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the results. Results: Our results supported that rumination is a meaningful mediator between childhood trauma and depression/anxiety in non-clinical participants. The mediation model indicated that childhood trauma and its subtypes are linked to depression and anxiety through three subtypes of rumination, thereby supporting a significant indirect relationship (Standardized coefficient [SC] = 0.56, p < 0.001 for the path from trauma to rumination; SC = 0.67, p < 0.001, from rumination to mood). The direct relationship between childhood trauma and mood symptoms was also significant in a model including rumination (SC = 0.68, p < 0.001). The mediation effect of rumination in the relationship between childhood trauma and mood was more predominant in female participants. Conclusions: The present study found that rumination mediates the influence of childhood trauma on the development of mood symptoms in non-clinical participants. Childhood trauma appears to be a critical determinant for developing symptoms of depression and anxiety. © 2017 Kim, Jin, Jung, Hahn and Lee.",0.4895397489539749
Number line estimation predicts mathematical skills: Difference in grades 2 and 4,2017,21,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029714948&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01576&partnerID=40&md5=2cfc6ec31e96cd25ea8275ae0fd1edba,"Studies have shown that number line estimation is important for learning. However, it is yet unclear if number line estimation predicts different mathematical skills in different grades after controlling for age, non-verbal cognitive ability, attention, and working memory. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of number line estimation on two mathematical skills (calculation fluency and math problem-solving) in grade 2 and grade 4. One hundred and forty-eight children from Shanghai, China were assessed on measures of number line estimation, non-verbal cognitive ability (non-verbal matrices), working memory (N-back), attention (expressive attention), and mathematical skills (calculation fluency and math problem-solving). The results showed that in grade 2, number line estimation correlated significantly with calculation fluency (r = -0.27, p < 0.05) and math problem-solving (r = -0.52, p < 0.01). In grade 4, number line estimation correlated significantly with math problem-solving (r = -0.38, p < 0.01), but not with calculation fluency. Regression analyses indicated that in grade 2, number line estimation accounted for unique variance in math problem-solving (12.0%) and calculation fluency (4.0%) after controlling for the effects of age, non-verbal cognitive ability, attention, and working memory. In grade 4, number line estimation accounted for unique variance in math problem-solving (9.0%) but not in calculation fluency. These findings suggested that number line estimation had an important role in math problem-solving for both grades 2 and 4 children and in calculation fluency for grade 2 children. We concluded that number line estimation could be a useful indicator for teachers to identify and improve children's mathematical skills. © 2017 Zhu, Cai and Leung.",0.47058823529411764

This effect has been found to be modulated by the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) and the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene (COMT) polymorphisms, which are on the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways and which are associated with affective processing. The current study aimed to identify new genetic variations of genes on dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways that may contribute to individual differences in the susceptibility to framing. Using genome-wide association data and the gene-based principal components regression method, we examined genetic variations of 26 genes on the pathways in 1317 Chinese Han participants. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the genetic variations of the SLC6A4 gene and the COMT gene were associated with the framing effect. More importantly, we demonstrated that the genetic variations of the aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (DDC) gene, which is involved in the synthesis of both dopamine and serotonin, contributed to individual differences in the susceptibility to framing. Our findings shed light on the understanding of the genetic basis of affective decision- making. © The Author (2017).",0.3422459893048128

While researchers suggest a prognostic role for TBR in AD/HD, its relationship to behavior remains uncertain. Recent evidence suggests that elevated TBR in AD/HD may be related to atypical inhibition, particularly at an attentional level. This study aimed to examine the performance on three inhibitory tasks of children with AD/HD. Fifty-eight children with AD/HD participated, divided into an elevated TBR (ET) group and a control group (CT). A behavioral disassociation was found − compared to CT, ET showed more difficulty in inhibiting surrounding stimuli but had less day-to-day inhibitory issues measured by BRIEF. There was no significant group difference on response inhibition. The results support the prognostic value of TBR in AD/HD. Elevated TBR may be an inhibitory biomarker; further studies are needed to explore the behavioral implications in patients without elevated TBR. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.42
Decisions for others are less risk-averse in the gain frame and less risk-seeking in the loss frame than decisions for the self,2017,41,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029645618&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01601&partnerID=40&md5=0757c2a871ae935da64e89570dacddea,"Despite the fact that people make decisions for others as often as they make decisions for themselves, little is known about how decisions for others are different from those made for the self. In two experiments, we investigated the effect of social distance (i.e., making decisions for oneself, a friend, or a stranger) on risk preferences in both gain and loss situations. We found that people were more risk averse in gain situations when they made decisions for themselves than for a stranger (Studies 1 and 2), but were equally risk averse for themselves and their friends (Study 2). However, people were more risk seeking in loss situations when they made decisions for themselves than for their friends as well as for a stranger, and were more risk seeking for their friends than for a stranger (Study 2). Furthermore, the effect of social distance on risk preferences was stronger in loss than in gain situations. Mediation analysis indicated that outcome-induced loss aversion was responsible for effects of social distance on risk preferences. These findings demonstrate that social distance influences risk preferences via perceived loss aversion, which sheds new light on self-other differences in decision making. © 2017 Zhang, Liu, Chen, Shang and Liu.",0.4873096446700508
Age-related changes in bimanual instrument playing with rhythmic cueing,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030183034&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01569&partnerID=40&md5=d79694d98f54fe9b378e7a410df5ffb2,"Deficits in bimanual coordination of older adults have been demonstrated to significantly limit their functioning in daily life. As a bimanual sensorimotor task, instrument playing has great potential for motor and cognitive training in advanced age. While the process of matching a person's repetitive movements to auditory rhythmic cueing during instrument playing was documented to involve motor and attentional control, investigation into whether the level of cognitive functioning influences the ability to rhythmically coordinate movement to an external beat in older populations is relatively limited. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine how timing accuracy during bimanual instrument playing with rhythmic cueing differed depending on the degree of participants' cognitive aging. Twenty one young adults, 20 healthy older adults, and 17 older adults with mild dementia participated in this study. Each participant tapped an electronic drum in time to the rhythmic cueing provided using both hands simultaneously and in alternation. During bimanual instrument playing with rhythmic cueing, mean and variability of synchronization errors were measured and compared across the groups and the tempo of cueing during each type of tapping task. Correlations of such timing parameters with cognitive measures were also analyzed. The results showed that the group factor resulted in significant differences in the synchronization errors-related parameters. During bimanual tapping tasks, cognitive decline resulted in differences in synchronization errors between younger adults and older adults with mild dimentia. Also, in terms of variability of synchronization errors, younger adults showed significant differences in maintaining timing performance from older adults with and without mild dementia, which may be attributed to decreased processing time for bimanual coordination due to aging. Significant correlations were observed between variability of synchronization errors and performance of cognitive tasks involving executive control and cognitive flexibility when asked for bimanual coordination in response to external timing cues at adjusted tempi. Also, significant correlations with cognitive measures were more prevalent in variability of synchronization errors during alternative tapping compared to simultaneous tapping. The current study supports that bimanual tapping may be predictive of cognitive processing of older adults. Also, tempo and type of movement required for instrument playing both involve cognitive and motor loads at different levels, and such variables could be important factors for determining the complexity of the task and the involved task requirements for interventions using instrument playing. © 2017 Kim, Cho and Yoo.",0.5572916666666666

Proposing its two aspects: self-focused relational self (i.e., perceiving the self as the object of other people's referential awareness or intentionality) and other-focused relational self (i.e., perceiving the self as being attuned and empathetically connected to close others), the current study explored the way the four selves affect well-being in Japan and South Korea, the East Asian cultures that have been assumed to be homogeneously collectivistic in previous psychological literature. Japanese and Korean participants rated a set of well-being and self-related scales. There were visible sample differences within culture by collection method (classroom vs. online) in relative degrees of selves and related constructs, possibly associated with generational differences. Other-focused relational self was greater in the Korean classroom sample than the Japanese counterpart, whereas no difference was found between the online samples. On the other hand, it was consistent between cultures that the two types of relational self showed different associations with social anxiety and self-esteem as expected, and that they predicted well-being in different ways. We discuss implications for the generational differences and their interactions with culture and the importance of separating the two aspects of relational self in the study of self and culture. © 2017 Park, Norasakkunkit and Kashima.",0.3767441860465116

However, the cognitive mechanism underlying regulatory efficiency, particularly the role of creativity, in cognitive reappraisal is unclear. Although previous studies have evaluated the relationship between creativity and reappraisal from the perspectives of generation (i.e., generating cognitive reappraisals and generating creative ideas involve similar cognitive neural networks) and individual differences (i.e., the ability to generate different cognitive reappraisals can be predicted by scores on creativity-related tests), how cognitive reappraisal's efficiency can be related to creativity is still unknown. In this research, we assessed the relationship between cognitive reappraisal's creativity and its effectiveness in regulating negative emotion. In Study 1, participants were asked to generate reappraisals of negative stimuli and then evaluate the creativity and regulatory effectiveness of these reappraisals. The results indicated positive correlation between creativity rating and regulatory effectiveness, but we found that it was difficult for the participants to generate highly creative reappraisals on their own. Therefore, in Study 2, we showed participants well-prepared reappraisal materials that varied in their creativity and asked them to evaluate their regulatory effectiveness and creativity. The results suggested that creativity and appropriateness were significant predictors of the regulating effects of the reappraisal and that creativity was the most dominant predictor. In summary, both experiments found a positive correlation between reappraisal's creativity and effectiveness, thus implying that creativity plays an important role in reappraisal. © 2017 Wu, Guo, Tang, Shi and Luo.",0.4380165289256198

Modifications were made in the cage to allow for a convenient installation of the slip ring and accommodation of animal ambient activity. We tested the apparatus for hippocampal EEG recordings in adult C57 black mice. Spontaneous recurrent seizures were induced using extended hippocampal kindling (≥95 daily stimulation). Control animals underwent similar hippocampal electrode implantations but no stimulations were given. Combined EEGand webcammonitoring were performed for 24 h daily for 5–9 consecutive days. During the monitoring periods, the animals moved and accessed water and food freely and showed no apparent restriction in ambient cage activities.

Self-reflection orients visual attention downward,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028752521&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01506&partnerID=40&md5=29c91b3c234d229788b2f15db22a0d0f,"Previous research has demonstrated abstract concepts associated with spatial location (e.g., God in the Heavens) could direct visual attention upward or downward, because thinking about the abstract concepts activates the corresponding vertical perceptual symbols. For self-concept, there are similar metaphors (e.g., ""I am above others""). However, whether thinking about the self can induce visual attention orientation is still unknown. Therefore, the current study tested whether self-reflection can direct visual attention. Individuals often display the tendency of self-enhancement in social comparison, which reminds the individual of the higher position one possesses relative to others within the social environment. As the individual is the agent of the attention orientation, and high status tends to make an individual look down upon others to obtain a sense of pride, it was hypothesized that thinking about the self would lead to a downward attention orientation. Using reflection of personality traits and a target discrimination task, Study 1 found that, after self-reflection, visual attention was directed downward. Similar effects were also found after friend-reflection, with the level of downward attention being correlated with the likability rating scores of the friend. Thus, in Study 2, a disliked other was used as a control and the positive self-view was measured with above-average judgment task. We found downward attention orientation after self-reflection, but not after reflection upon the disliked other. Moreover, the attentional bias after self-reflection was correlated with above-average self-view. The current findings provide the first evidence that thinking about the self could direct visual-spatial attention downward, and suggest that this effect is probably derived from a positive self-view within the social context. © 2017 Liu, Tong and Li.",0.3707865168539326
Delayed mismatch field latencies in autism spectrum disorder with abnormal auditory sensitivity: A magnetoencephalographic study,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032029572&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00446&partnerID=40&md5=3f3de21e67116c751e6565918201dcdb,"Although abnormal auditory sensitivity is the most common sensory impairment associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the neurophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. In previous studies, we reported that this abnormal sensitivity in patients with ASD is associated with delayed and prolonged responses in the auditory cortex. In the present study, we investigated alterations in residual M100 and MMFs in children with ASD who experience abnormal auditory sensitivity. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) tomeasure MMF elicited by an auditory oddball paradigm(standard tones: 300Hz, deviant tones: 700 Hz) in 20 boys with ASD (11 with abnormal auditory sensitivity: mean age, 9.62 ± 1.82 years, 9 without: mean age, 9.07 ± 1.31 years) and 13 typically developing boys (mean age, 9.45 ± 1.51 years). We found that temporal and frontal residual M100/MMF latencies were significantly longer only in children with ASD who have abnormal auditory sensitivity. In addition, prolonged residual M100/MMF latencies were correlated with the severity of abnormal auditory sensitivity in temporal and frontal areas of both hemispheres. Therefore, our findings suggest that children with ASD and abnormal auditory sensitivity may have atypical neural networks in the primary auditory area, as well as in brain areas associated with attention switching and inhibitory control processing. This is the first report of an MEG study demonstrating altered MMFs to an auditory oddball paradigm in patients with ASD and abnormal auditory sensitivity. These findings contribute to knowledge of the mechanisms for abnormal auditory sensitivity in ASD, and may therefore facilitate development of novel clinical interventions. © 2017 Matsuzaki, Kagitani-Shimono, Sugata, Hanaie, Nagatani, Yamamoto, Tachibana, Tominaga, Hirata, Mohri and Taniike.",0.46747967479674796
Neural activity patterns in the human brain reflect tactile stickiness perception,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032033665&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00445&partnerID=40&md5=5dd394f61eeea5e9d14a545b04ee386c,"Our previous human fMRI study found brain activations correlated with tactile stickiness perception using the uni-variate general linear model (GLM) (Yeon et al., 2017). Here, we conducted an in-depth investigation on neural correlates of sticky sensations by employing a multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) on the same dataset. In particular, we statistically compared multi-variate neural activities in response to the three groups of sticky stimuli: A supra-threshold group including a set of sticky stimuli that evoked vivid sticky perception; an infra-threshold group including another set of sticky stimuli that barely evoked sticky perception; and a sham group including acrylic stimuli with no physically sticky property. Searchlight MVPAs were performed to search for local activity patterns carrying neural information of stickiness perception. Similar to the uni-variate GLM results, significant multi-variate neural activity patterns were identified in postcentral gyrus, subcortical (basal ganglia and thalamus), and insula areas (insula and adjacent areas). Moreover, MVPAs revealed that activity patterns in posterior parietal cortex discriminated the perceptual intensities of stickiness, which was not present in the uni-variate analysis. Next, we applied a principal component analysis (PCA) to the voxel response patterns within identified clusters so as to find low-dimensional neural representations of stickiness intensities. Follow-up clustering analyses clearly showed separate neural grouping configurations between the Supra- and Infra-threshold groups. Interestingly, this neural categorization was in line with the perceptual grouping pattern obtained from the psychophysical data. Our findings thus suggest that different stickiness intensities would elicit distinct neural activity patterns in the human brain and may provide a neural basis for the perception and categorization of tactile stickiness. © 2017 Kim, Yeon, Ryu, Park, Chung and Kim.",0.43283582089552236
The time course of inhibition of return: Evidence from steady-state visual evoked potentials,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029693059&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01562&partnerID=40&md5=728eedd7576a2fece8349ef183810714,"Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to slower responses to targets at a previously cued location than that at an uncued location. The time course of IOR has long been a topic of interest in the field. Investigations into the time course of IOR are typically performed by examining the magnitude of IOR under various cue-target onset asynchrony (CTOA) conditions. Therefore, the results are vulnerable to influence of factors that could affect the target processes (e.g., the frequency of the target type). In the present study, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were implemented to directly take a continuous measurement of the degree to which cued location is processed, eliminating the influence mentioned above. The results indicate that, relative to the baseline interval (-400 to 0 ms), the presence of peripheral cues generated a typical two-stage effect on the SSVEP amplitude evoked by a 20 Hz flicker. Specifically, after the onset of the peripheral cues, the SSVEP amplitude first showed a significant increase, which subsequently turned into a significant inhibition effect after 200 ms. These results provide a continuous time course diagram of the cueing effect and suggest an effective way for future investigations of controlling the masking effects of target stimuli processing on IOR. © 2017 Li, Zhang, Miao, Wang, Zhang and Zhang.",0.4223300970873786
Two strains of Lymnaea stagnalis and the progeny from their mating display differential memory-forming ability on associative learning tasks,2017,15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039855122&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00161&partnerID=40&md5=25ed59226313d9e67b88451b638d19fc,"The pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis learns and forms long-term memory (LTM) following both operant conditioning of aerial respiratory behavior and classical conditioning of taste aversive behavior. In the present study, we examined whether there are interstrain differences in the ability to form LTM following these two types of conditioning. A strain of Lymnaea (TC1) collected in Alberta, Canada exhibits superior memory-forming ability following aerial respiratory operant conditioning compared to a laboratory-reared strain of Lymnaea from Netherlands known as the Dutch strain. We asked whether the offspring of the Canadian TC1 and Dutch snails (i.e., filial 1 (F1 ) cross snails) would have the superior memory ability and found, rather, that their memory ability was average like the Dutch snails. That is, the Canadian TC1 snails have superior ability for LTM formation following aerial respiratory operant conditioning, but the Dutch and the generated F1 cross have average ability for memory forming. We next examined the Canadian TC1, Dutch and F1 cross snails for their ability to learn and form memory following conditioned taste aversion (CTA). All three populations showed similar associative CTA responses. However, both LTM formation and the ratio of good-to-poor performers in the memory retention test were much better in the Dutch snails than the Canadian TC1 and F1 cross snails. The memory abilities of the Canadian TC1 and F1 cross snails were average. Our present findings, therefore, suggest that snails of different strains have different memory abilities, and the F1 cross snails do not inherit the memory ability from the smart strain. To our knowledge, there have been a limited number of studies examining differences in memory ability among invertebrate strains, with the exception of studies using mutant flies. © 2017 Sunada, Totani, Nakamura, Sakakibara, Lukowiak and Ito.",0.42657342657342656
Does growing up in urban compared to rural areas shape primary emotional traits?,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042173106&doi=10.3390%2fbs7030060&partnerID=40&md5=f671d86572c322da5ea33e8631ac5874,"Growing up in urban areas represents a possible risk factor in the genesis of psychopathologies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the link between urbanicity variables and indicators for psychiatric disorders. We investigated a potential association between primary emotional traits and urbanicity variables in 324 individuals from Germany and 713 individuals from China. Higher scores in the urbanicity index in childhood were inversely associated with FEAR and SADNESS only in adult Chinese females. These effects seemed to be driven by living in Chinese mega-cities, because a parallel sample from Germany and China (contrasting upbringing in cities with the categories <10,000 inhabitants, ≥10,000 inhabitants (but <100,000), and ≥100,000 inhabitants) resulted in weaker, but more similar effects in females in both countries. Additional associations could be observed with higher PLAY and urban upbringing in Chinese males. The results seem surprising, given an expectation of adverse emotional effects from growing up in todays' mega-cities compared to rural areas. Although we do not want to over-interpret our findings (given rather small correlations and multiple testing issues), they should encourage researchers to consider including urbanicity variables in personality neuroscience and personality oriented clinical psychiatric research. © 2017 by the authors.

Participants rated 88 different traits, which were clustered in 10 different preference domains. In-law preferences were found to be contingent on the sex of the in-law and the sex of the parent. The data from the current study were compared with data from a different study which took place in the Republic of Cyprus. It was found that preferences varied in the two samples, but specific cultural differences were identified. It was also found that for both samples, the 10 different domains clustered in two supra-domains.

We tested the influence of 3 key factors- emotional salience of information, group structure, and information distribution-on mnemonic transmission, social contagion, and collective memory. Participants individually studied emotionally salient (negative or positive) and nonemotional (neutral) picture-word pairs that were completely shared, partially shared, or unshared within participant triads, and then completed 3 consecutive recalls in 1 of 3 conditions: individual-individual-individual (control), collaborative- collaborative (identical group; insular structure)-individual, and collaborative- collaborative (reconfigured group; diverse structure)-individual. Collaboration enhanced negative memories especially in insular group structure and especially for shared information, and promoted collective forgetting of positive memories. Diverse group structure reduced this negativity effect. Unequally distributed information led to social contagion that creates false memories; diverse structure propagated a greater variety of false memories whereas insular structure promoted confidence in false recognition and false collective memory. A simultaneous assessment of network structure, information distribution, and emotional valence breaks new ground to specify how network structure shapes the spread of negative memories and false memories, and the emergence of collective memory. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.6321243523316062

A simulation study and an empirical study were conducted under comprehensive conditions. Results suggested that with negatively skewed distribution, the CC indices were larger than with other distributions. Interactions occurred among ability distribution, cut score location, and score scale.

We examine how English and Japanese speakers perceive similarity of pairs of objects, by using two sets of stimuli: one in which two distinct linguistic categories apply to respective object images in English, but only one linguistic category applies in Japanese; and another in which two distinct linguistic categories apply to respective object images in Japanese, but only one applies in English. We conducted four studies and tested different groups of participants in each of them. In Study 1, we asked participants to name the two objects before engaging in the similarity judgment task. Here, we expected a strong linguistic effect. In Study 2, we asked participants to engage in the same task without naming, where we assumed that the condition is close enough to our daily visual information processing where language is not necessarily prompted. We further explored whether the language still influences the similarity perception by asking participants to engage in the same task basing on the visual similarity (Study 3) and the functional similarity (Study 4). The results overall indicated that English and Japanese speakers perceived the two objects to be more similar when they were in the same linguistic categories than when they were in different linguistic categories in their respective languages.

Here the authors examined the effects of facial movements on face processing developmentally in children (8-year-olds), adolescents (12-year-olds), and adults (20- year-olds). In particular, the composite face effect was used to measure the influence of facial movements on part-based versus holistic processing after participants had viewed either a moving or static face in a within-subject design. Experiment 1 examined elastic facial movement (i.e., blinking and chewing). The results showed that children, adolescents, and adults exhibited a significantly smaller composite effect after viewing a moving face than after viewing a static face. This result indicates that elastic facial movement facilitates part-based face processing from at least 8 years of age onward. Experiment 2 examined rigid facial movement (i.e., head turning) and revealed that it too facilitates part-based face processing in children, adolescents, and adults. The results taken together suggest that contrary to the prevailing view, facial movements facilitate part-based, not holistic, face processing in children, adolescents, and adults. The findings call for revision in the conventional way of thinking about what constitutes the developmental trajectory toward mature face processing and also point to the importance of using more naturalistic moving face stimuli to study face processing and its development. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.5316455696202531

A second experiment assessed performance in an alternative uses task and a figural combination task while participants were lying, sitting, or standing. Results showed better performance when standing up than when lying or sitting. Taken altogether, these observations provide evidence for an approach in terms of cognitive-control depletion: the more a bodily activity exhausts control resources, the better divergent thinking can unfold, presumably because reduced top-down control brings more ideas into play. © 2017 Zhou, Zhang, Hommel and Zhang.",0.5241379310344828

Nineteen boys between 4 and 7 years of age with ASD were compared to 28 TD boys while listening to musical stimuli of different aesthetic levels. The results from two musical experiments using the above participants, are described here. In the first study, responses to a Mozart minuet and a dissonant altered version of the same Mozart minuet were compared. In this first study, the results indicated that both ASD and TD males preferred listening to the original consonant version of the minuet over the altered dissonant version. With the same participants,the second experiment included musical stimuli from four renowned composers: Mozart and Bach's musical works, both considered consonant in their harmonic structure, were compared with music from Schoenberg and Albinoni, two composers who wrote musical works considered exceedingly harmonically dissonant. In the second study, when the stimuli included consonant or dissonant musical stimuli from different composers, the children with ASD showed greater preference for the aesthetic quality of the highly dissonant music compared to the TD children. While children in both of the groups listened to the consonant stimuli of Mozart and Bach music for the same amount of time, the children with ASD listened to the dissonant music of Schoenberg and Albinoni longer than the TD children. As preferring dissonant music is more aesthetically demanding perceptually, these results suggest that ASD male children demonstrate an enhanced capability of aesthetic judgment of music. Subsidiary data collected after the completion of the experiment revealed that absolute pitch ability was prevalent only in the children with ASD, some of whom also possessed extraordinary musical memory. The implications of these results are discussed with reference to the broader notion of neurodiversity, a term coined to capture potentially gifted qualities in individuals diagnosed with ASD. © 2017 Masataka.",0.4169278996865204

Additionally, greater preference for kind and understanding by parents than by children as well as by daughters than by sons, and greater preference for social status by the daughters’ than by the sons’ parents have not been observed in the rating and the ranking instrument.

In two subsequent experiments, participants experienced high levels of embodiment of a robotic arm that had a blue end effector with no fingers (Experiment 1) and of a robotic arm that ended with a gripper (Experiment 2) when it was stroked synchronously with the real arm. Levels of embodiment were significantly higher than the corresponding asynchronous condition and similar to those reported for a human-looking arm. Additionally, we found that visuo-movement synchronization also induced embodiment of the robot arm and that embodiment was even partially maintained when the robot hand was covered with a blue plastic cover. We conclude that humans are able to experience a strong sense of embodiment towards non-human looking robot arms. The results have important implications for the domains related to robotic embodiment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0.363013698630137

Method A is the simplest online calibration method and has attracted many attentions from researchers recently. However, a key assumption of Method A is that it treats person-parameter estimates (Formula presented.)

To improve the performance of Method A, a new method, MLE-LBCI-Method A, is proposed. This new method combines a modified Lord’s bias-correction method (named as maximum likelihood estimation-Lord’s bias-correction with iteration [MLE-LBCI]) with the original Method A in an effort to correct the deviation of (Formula presented.) which may adversely affect the item calibration precision. Two simulation studies were carried out to explore the performance of both MLE-LBCI and MLE-LBCI-Method A under several scenarios.

On the other hand, rapid economic growth can improve fiscal health in poorer, relatively young countries with still-growing working-age populations. Overall, our results indicate that Asia’s population aging will adversely affect its fiscal sustainability, pointing to a need for Asian countries to further examine the impact of demographic shifts on their fiscal health. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0.5433070866141733
Behavioral oscillations in visual attention modulated by Task difficulty,2017,23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030166577&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01630&partnerID=40&md5=fed36d075dfaf62c91a46648a11112e3,"The spotlight of attention is full of discrete moments and operates periodically. Recently, it has been well-documented there were behavioral oscillations in visual attention, however, different periodicities were demonstrated. Task difficulty may be an important factor causing disagreement in attentional periodic patterns. The present study examined behavioral oscillations in visual attention during difficult and easy tasks. A modified high temporal resolution cue-target paradigm in which the cue-target stimulus onset asynchrony (SOAs) varied from 0.1 to 1.08 s in steps of 20 ms was used. The target was detected with the accuracy of 65% in the difficult condition and 75% in the easy condition. Oscillatory patterns were analyzed and observed in behavioral performance. A theta rhythm was visible in the difficult version. However, attention oscillation increased to a higher frequency in the easy version. Task difficulty was negatively related to power for all bands. Our findings suggest that the attention spotlight switched faster when the task was easy, while, it switched much more slowly when the task was difficult in order to obtain more information. A flexible mechanism for attention spotlight was demonstrated, and task demand modulated attention oscillations. © 2017 Chen, Wang, Wang, Tang and Zhang.",0.47619047619047616

Using a naturalistic laboratory experiment the present study tested 35 infants at 3 ages: 4 months (15 infants), 5 months (12 infants), and 7 months (8 infants). While they were engaged frontally with one experimenter, infants were presented with (a) a second experimenter's voice and (b) castanet sounds from three different locations (left, right, and behind). There were clear increases with age in the successful localization of sounds from all directions, and a decrease in the number of repetitions required for success. Nonetheless even at 4 months two-thirds of the infants attempted to search for the voice or sound. At all ages localizing sounds from behind was more difficult and was clearly present only at 7 months. Perseverative errors (looking at the last location) were present at all ages and appeared to be task specific (only present in the 7 month-olds for the behind location). Spontaneous attention shifts by the infants between the two experimenters, evident at 7 months, suggest early evidence for infant initiation of triadic attentional engagements. There was no advantage found for voice over castanet sounds in this study. Auditory localization is a complex and contextual process emerging gradually in the first half of the first year. © 2017 Kezuka, Amano and Reddy.",0.5169082125603864

Is Trusting Others Related to Better Health? An Investigation of Older Adults Across Six Non-Western Countries,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027721721&doi=10.1177%2f0022022117722632&partnerID=40&md5=e362353c60f4360a4370deb1a079b5ab,"Generalized trust reflects whether individuals extend their trust to others in general and is important to health and well-being. This study examined the predictive effect of generalized trust on health, happiness, life satisfaction, health behaviors, and illnesses among older adults residing in six non-Western countries. We utilized a recent multinational dataset collected by the World Health Organization that included measures of generalized trust, health, happiness, life satisfaction, health behaviors (physical activity, diet), health-compromising behaviors (sedentary behavior, cigarette, and alcohol consumption), and illnesses (e.g., angina, arthritis, asthma, cataracts, depression, hypertension, and lung disease) among adults aged 50 and older. The sample comprised a total of 35,329 adults (M age = 63.54) from China, Ghana, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Russia. An index of the development of these countries was also entered into the analyses. Hierarchical multiple regression showed that generalized trust was a significant and positive predictor of self-rated health, happiness, life satisfaction, and quality of life, and a negative predictor of illness (i.e., angina, arthritis, asthma, cataracts, diabetes, depression, hypertension, and stroke) and sedentary behavior. The associations were stronger for countries with a higher Human Development Index (HDI) than those with a low HDI. While the findings from this first multinational investigation of non-Western developing countries are consistent with the results of previous studies in Western developed countries, they also underscore their cross-societal variability. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.42792792792792794
An associative account of the development of word learning,2017,41,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033375599&doi=10.1016%2fj.cogpsych.2017.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=9b73fe9ffdc98935d2043b1eb370e204,"Word learning is a notoriously difficult induction problem because meaning is underdetermined by positive examples. How do children solve this problem? Some have argued that word learning is achieved by means of inference: young word learners rely on a number of assumptions that reduce the overall hypothesis space by favoring some meanings over others. However, these approaches have difficulty explaining how words are learned from conversations or text, without pointing or explicit instruction. In this research, we propose an associative mechanism that can account for such learning. In a series of experiments, 4-year-olds and adults were presented with sets of words that included a single nonsense word (e.g. dax). Some lists were taxonomic (i.,e., all items were members of a given category), some were associative (i.e., all items were associates of a given category, but not members), and some were mixed. Participants were asked to indicate whether the nonsense word was an animal or an artifact. Adults exhibited evidence of learning when lists consisted of either associatively or taxonomically related items. In contrast, children exhibited evidence of word learning only when lists consisted of associatively related items. These results present challenges to several extant models of word learning, and a new model based on the distinction between syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations is proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.413953488372093

Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to interfere with the executive control functions of the right rostrolateral PFC (RLPFC) or the right rostromedial PFC (RMPFC). Subjects performed a task-switching paradigm, which included spatial detection (SD), prospective memory (PM) and working memory (WM) tasks, after cTBS. The performance of 18 healthy volunteers was evaluated on different days after cTBS over the right RLPFC, the right RMPFC, and the vertex (serving as a control site). The application of cTBS over the RLPFC significantly increased the switching costs (SCs) of the error rates (ERs) when switching to the PM task, while RMPFC-cTBS decreased SCs of ERs when switching to the WM task, compared with the control vertex site. These findings provide evidence for a differential role of the RLPFC and the RMPFC in executive functions, with a specific involvement of the RLPFC and the RMPFC in PM, and WM, respectively. © 2017 He, Fan and Li.",0.37433155080213903

We find that when participants make decisions for their future selves, they are less loss averse compared to when they make decisions for their current selves. This finding is consistent with the interpretation of loss aversion as a bias in decision-making driven by emotions, which are reduced when making decisions for future selves. Our findings endorsed the external validity of previous studies on the impact of emotion on loss aversion in a real world decision-making environment. © 2017 Cheng and He.",0.4205607476635514
Mental fatigue and spatial references impair soccer players' physical and tactical performances,2017,78,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029695428&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01645&partnerID=40&md5=50f7dbb55abf2bbe4d66d1d57e0d6ad2,"This study examined the effects of mental fatigue and additional corridor and pitch sector lines on players' physical and tactical performances during soccer small-sided games. Twelve youth players performed four Gk+6vs6+Gk small-sided games. Prior to the game, one team performed a motor coordination task to induce mental fatigue, while the other one performed a control task. A repeated measures design allowed to compare players' performances across four conditions: (a) with mental fatigue against opponents without mental fatigue in a normal pitch (MEN), (b) with mental fatigue on a pitch with additional reference lines (#MEN); (c) without mental fatigue against mentally fatigued opponents on a normal pitch (CTR); and (d) without mental fatigue on a pitch with reference lines (#CTR). Player's physical performance was assessed by the distance covered per minute and the number of accelerations and decelerations (0.5-3.0 m/s2; > -3.0 m/s2). Positional data was used to determine individual (spatial exploration index, time synchronized in longitudinal and lateral directions) and team-related variables (length, width, speed of dispersion and contraction). Unclear effects were found for the physical activity measures in most of the conditions. There was a small decrease in time spent laterally synchronized and a moderate decrease in the contraction speed when MEN compared to the CTR. Also, there was a small decrease in the time spent longitudinally synchronized during the #MEN condition compared to MEN. The results showed that mental fatigue affects the ability to use environmental information and players' positioning, while the additional reference lines may have enhanced the use of less relevant information to guide their actions during the #MEN condition. Overall, coaches could manipulate the mental fatigue and reference lines to induce variability and adaptation in young soccer players' behavior. © 2017 Coutinho, Gonçalves, Travassos, Wong, Coutts and Sampaio.",0.4930555555555556
Importance modulates the temporal features of self-referential processing: An event-related potential study,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032017572&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00470&partnerID=40&md5=bc6851973f6733272ed051bac46e1dcc,"A growing number of studies have demonstrated preferential processing of self-related information. However, previous research has been limited in examining the distinction between processes related to the self and those related to the non-self, it remains unclear how self-related information with differing levels of importance is processed within the self. The present study examined how the importance of self-related content affects the neural activity involved in self-referential processing. The behavioral results showed that the participants had faster responses to more important self-related content. The event-related potential (ERP) results showed that early attention resources were diverted to the identification of highly important self-related content compared with minimally important self-related content, as reflected by the enhanced P200. Furthermore, the N200 amplitude for highly important self-related content was smaller than for moderately important self-related content which, in turn, were smaller than minimally important self-related content. Moreover, the P300 amplitudes were modulated by the degree of importance of self-related content, whereby a higher importance of self-related content led to larger P300 amplitudes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate an effect of the degree of importance of the self-related content at both behavioral and neurophysiological levels. © 2017 Xu, Li, Ren, Xia, Xue, Zhou and Xu.",0.36363636363636365

Second, in the experiment involving 6-year-old children who participated in the class, writing movements of children and their changes over the period of hiragana education were analyzed for each stroke composing letters. It was found that writing movement of children became differentiated in a manner specific to the different types of stroke endings, to which children were systematically encouraged to attend in the classroom.

A total of 420 Chinese children (220 boys, Mean age = 9.74 ± 0.45) participated in the research. Autistic traits were measured in the 4th grade and emotion regulation, school connectedness and IGA measured in both the 4th and 5th grades. After controlling for age, sex, and sensation seeking, results showed that autistic traits were related to decreased emotion regulation, which in turn was related to lower school connectedness, which was related to increased IGA. The results suggest that improving emotion regulation and school connectedness could reduce the risk of IGA. As a result, these findings may inform intervention and prevention programs targeting children with IGA, especially among those with high levels of autistic traits. © 2017",0.44274809160305345

Studies have shown that closure can be affected by several factors, specifically by low-level image features. However, the effects of high-level non-image factors on grouping by closure are unknown. In two experiments we investigated how closure is affected when depth information is introduced to the 2D closed contours, whilst the other 2D features remain intact. The first experiment showed that the grouping of closed contours was disrupted by the manipulation in 3D layout. The second experiment showed that thus disruption resulted in the impairment of searching efficiency.

This study evaluated the efficacy of an intervention aimed at improving the mental health of people living with HIV (PLH) and their family members. Method: A randomized controlled trial of 475 PLH and 522 family members was conducted in Anhui, China. The intervention comprised activities at individual, family, and community levels. The study outcomes, which included depressive symptoms and coping with illness for the PLH and depressive symptoms and caregiver burden for the family members, were assessed at baseline and at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-up. We used a mixed-effects regression model with village- and participant-level random effects to assess the intervention effect on the improvement of outcome measures. Results: Relative to the control condition, the PLH and family members of the intervention group reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. The largest difference in depressive symptoms was observed at 6 months for the PLH and at 12 months for family members. Decreases in perceived caregiver burden over time were observed for family members in both conditions; however, the group difference did not reach statistical significance. Significant intervention effect on the coping with illness was reported by the PLH. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of empowering families affected by HIV to confront the challenges together rather than individually. It may be optimal for future programs to include both PLH and their family members to maximize intervention effects through strengthening interactions and support within a family. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.5183673469387755
A Commentary Reflection of Moral Psychology Based on Embodied Cognition,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163855189&doi=10.14746%2feip.2017.2.5&partnerID=40&md5=5bd653f51cbf366b2d5f6ded4f9e40a5,"The rise of embodied cognition in recent ten years has brought about significant influence on the research of moral psychology. On the one hand, the development of neuro-cognitive science has facilitated the research of morality deeply into the mirror neurons of brain, no longer being limited simply on the philosophical speculation; and on the other hand the experimental research of embodied cognition has provided new evidence for some traditional and philosophical moral issues and even made some new recognition of the issues which are different from the traditional interpretations. Tracing back to the research of the Western moral psychology, we find that cognitive rationality and virtual ethics are the two main research lines for moral psychology.（1）J. Piaget and L. Kohlberg opened a way for the research of cognitive development of morality, and their successors have formed new Kohlbergian School, such as the moral judgment theory based on DIT proposed by J. Rest and his colleagues, G. Lind’s dual-aspect theory based on his MCT and KMDD®; the social cognitive domain theory proposed by E. Turiel and his colleagues; the feminine caring ethics advocated by C. Gilligan and N. Noddings; the Social Intuitionist Theory proposed by J. Haidt based on evolutionary psychology, cultural psychology and neuro-cognitive science and so on. (2) The traditional moral philosophy and ethics have opened another way to the research of character education and virtues, such as the American movement of character education facilitated by W, Bennett and T. Lickona and others; the argument between J. Rawls and R. Nozick on moral problems; A. C. MacIntyre’s moral critique to the Western societies and his virtue ethics and so on. Since 21st century the research of embodied cognition has broken through the limitation of the traditional research on moral psychology, attempting to realize the new synthesis of intellect, human body and its environment, and therefore started the embodied research of moral judgment which is unfolded around the three dimensions of physical cleanliness, disgust, body temperature and body movements. I has also assimilated Piaget and Vygotsky’s ideas of psychological development, the theory of conceptual metaphor in cognitive semantics and the theory of evolutionary psychology, and made its theoretical interpretation and exploration for the embodied effect of moral judgment. Since the variable of physical body could have its influence on individual moral judgment by means of one’s emotion and cognitive elements, the moral judgment based on embodied cognition should be integrated with the theories of moral judgment, especially with moral competencies that are the core of moral judgment, and meanwhile the relationship between the embodied cognition and moral intuition should be deeply explored, and the issues such as chronergy, that is, time efficiency, and dynamics taken place when there is the embodied effect should be further examined, the regulated variables of embodied effects while making moral judgment and the individual differences should also be found out through detailed research. And finally we should check out the embodied effects of moral judgment through the cross-cultural comparison. © 2017, Adam Mickiewicz University, Faculty of Philosophy.

Method Participants (N = 756), originating from five countries (British, Chinese, Greek, Spanish, and Swedish), completed a questionnaire that measured perceived coach-athlete relationship quality, basic psychological need satisfaction, self-determined motivation, and well-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the data. Results Analysis revealed that athletes who perceived a high quality relationship experienced heightened levels of basic need satisfaction. Need satisfaction positively predicted self-determined motivation, which, in turn, linked to enhanced well-being. Moreover, mediation analyses supported the explanatory roles of need satisfaction and self-determined motivation within the model. Lastly, multi-sample SEM invariance testing revealed the model to be largely invariant across cultures. Conclusions The results support the universal application of self-determination theory and the central role interpersonal relationships play in promoting well-being. © 2017",0.43125

Using the index of degree of centrality (DC), we explored distant synchronization of background network in MCI during a hybrid delayed-match-to-sample task (DMST), which mainly relies on the working memory component of executive function. We observed significant interactions between group and cognitive state in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the ventral subregion of precuneus. For normal control (NC) group, the long distance functional connectivity (FC) of the PCC/precuneus with the other regions of the brain was higher in rest state than that working memory state. For MCI patients, however, this pattern altered. There was no significant difference between rest and working memory state. The similar pattern was observed in the other cluster located in the right angular gyrus. To examine whether abnormal DC in PCC/precuneus and angular gyrus partially resulted from the deficit of FC between these regions and the other parts in the whole brain, we conducted a seed-based correlation analysis with these regions as seeds. The results indicated that the FC between bilateral PCC/precuneus and the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) increased from rest to working memory state for NC participants. For MCI patients, however, there was no significant change between rest and working memory state. The similar pattern was observed for the FC between right angular gyrus and right anterior insula. However, there was no difference between MCI and NC groups in global efficiency and modularity. It may indicate a lack of efficient reorganization from rest state to a working memory state in the brain network of MCI patients. The present study demonstrates the altered distant synchronization of background network in MCI during a task relying on executive function. The results provide a new perspective regarding the neural mechanisms of executive function deficits in MCI patients, and extend our understanding of brain patterns in task-evoked cognitive states. © 2017 Wang, Li, Yu, Huang, Yan, Zhao and Li.",0.43843843843843844

Simultaneous multivariate regression analysis showed that the predictive values of pain avoidance scores and BDI scores for suicidal ideation were more significant than that of the PAS scores. Subsequently, 42 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), 39 students with subthreshold depression (SD), and 18 healthy controls were voluntarily recruited. Students with SD were divided into high suicidal ideation (HSI-SD) and low suicidal ideation (LSI-SD) groups. Pain avoidance scores and BDI scores differed significantly among the MDD, HSI-SD, LSI-SD, and healthy control groups. Pain avoidance and BSI scores were significantly higher in the MDD and HSI-SD groups than those in the LSI-SD and healthy control groups. However, no significant difference was observed in BDI scores between the HSI-SD and LSI-SD groups. Pain avoidance and depression, rather than psychache, may be promising predictors of suicidal ideation in a Chinese young adult population. © 2017 Li, Fu, Zou and Cui.",0.4719626168224299
The impact of education and health heterogeneity on Generational Support Ratios: A cross-national comparison between Mexico and Korea,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84982938303&doi=10.1017%2fS0144686X16000751&partnerID=40&md5=a6189ab3a524e7a964dab8a8ec3e83c1,"Policy makers are concerned about the socio-economic consequences of population ageing. Policies often rely on estimations of support ratios based solely on the population age structure. We estimate Generational Support Ratios (GSRs) considering health heterogeneity of the population age 60+ and education heterogeneity of their offspring. We explore the effect of a public policy that changes the education of a targeted sub-group of women when they are young on their health once they become older, taking into account changes in demographic processes (i.e. marriage, fertility, offspring's education). We used the model presented by Kye et al. for the Korean context and examine the Mexican context. Our paper has three objectives. First, by applying this framework to the Mexican context we aim to find that improvements in women's education may mitigate the negative consequences of population ageing directly and indirectly through subsequent demographic behaviours that altogether affect GSRs. Second, by making a cross-national comparison between Korea and Mexico, we aim to quantify how policies of educational expansion have different impacts in contexts in which the population age 60+ have universal access to health care compared to contexts in which access to health care is selective. Third, by comparing cross-nationally we aim to show how differences in family processes across countries alter the pathways through which improvements in education affect GSRs.

The effect for Japanese workers of a self-help computerized cognitive behaviour therapy program with a supplement soft drink,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029645254&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0109-5&partnerID=40&md5=53f177762c05455d967f18e13bd3fe67,"Background: Computerized cognitive behaviour therapy (CCBT) programs can provide a useful self-help approach to the treatment of psychological problems. Previous studies have shown that CCBT has moderate effects on depression, insomnia, and anxiety. The present study investigated whether a supplement drink that includes L-carnosine enhances the effect of CCBT on psychological well-being. Methods: Eighty-seven participants were randomly allocated to a control group, CCBT, or CCBT with supplement drink. The CCBT and CCBT with supplement drink groups received six weekly self-help CCBT program instalments, which consisted of psycho-education about stress management and coping, behaviour activation, and cognitive restructuring. The CCBT group consumed a bottle of the supplement soft drink every morning through the 6 weeks. This program was delivered by an e-learning system on demand and also included a self-help guidebook. Seventy-two participants completed the program or were assess at the end of the study. Results: ANOVA revealed that there were significant interactions (times × groups) for POMS tension-anxiety and fatigue. The CCBT group showed significantly improved tension-anxiety scores, whereas the CCBT with drink group showed significant improvements on fatigue. Conclusion: The self-help CCBT program reduced the subjective experience of tension-anxiety in this group of workers. The addition of a supplement drink enhanced the effect of CCBT on fatigue, providing one possible approach to enhancement of such programs.

Effects of sleep on word pair memory in children - separating item and source memory aspects,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028958582&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01533&partnerID=40&md5=caa916400660186026e05ed3fd392b21,"Word paired-associate learning is a well-established task to demonstrate sleepdependent memory consolidation in adults as well as children. Sleep has also been proposed to benefit episodic features of memory, i.e., a memory for an event (item) bound into the spatiotemporal context it has been experienced in (source). We aimed to explore if sleep enhances word pair memory in children by strengthening the episodic features of the memory, in particular. Sixty-one children (8-12 years) studied two lists of word pairs with 1 h in between. Retrieval testing comprised cued recall of the target word of each word pair (item memory) and recalling in which list the word pair had appeared in (source memory). Retrieval was tested either after 1 h (short retention interval) or after 11 h, with this long retention interval covering either nocturnal sleep or daytime wakefulness. Compared with the wake interval, sleep enhanced separate recall of both word pairs and the lists per se, while recall of the combination of the word pair and the list it had appeared in remained unaffected by sleep. An additional comparison with adult controls (n = 37) suggested that item-source bound memory (combined recall of word pair and list) is generally diminished in children. Our results argue against the view that the sleep-induced enhancement in paired-associate learning in children is a consequence of sleep specifically enhancing the episodic features of the memory representation. On the contrary, sleep in children might strengthen item and source representations in isolation, while leaving the episodic memory representations (item-source binding) unaffected. © 2017 Wang, Weber, Zinke, Noack and Born.",0.39763779527559057
Changes in electroencephalography complexity using a brain computer interface-motor observation training in chronic stroke patients: A fuzzy approximate entropy analysis,2017,36,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032004523&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00444&partnerID=40&md5=c48691697aed3072555432631ad3ae80,"Entropy-based algorithms have been suggested as robust estimators of electroencephalography (EEG) predictability or regularity. This study aimed to examine possible disturbances in EEG complexity as a means to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms in chronic stroke, before and after a brain computer interface (BCI)-motor observation intervention. Eleven chronic stroke subjects and nine unimpaired subjects were recruited to examine the differences in their EEG complexity. The BCI-motor observation intervention was designed to promote functional recovery of the hand in stroke subjects. Fuzzy approximate entropy (fApEn), a novel entropy-based algorithm designed to evaluate complexity in physiological systems, was applied to assess the EEG signals acquired from unimpaired subjects and stroke subjects, both before and after training. The results showed that stroke subjects had significantly lower EEG fApEn than unimpaired subjects (p < 0.05) in the motor cortex area of the brain (C3, C4, FC3, FC4, CP3, and CP4) in both hemispheres before training. After training, motor function of the paretic upper limb, assessed by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb (FMA-UL), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) improved significantly (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the EEG fApEn in stroke subjects increased considerably in the central area of the contralesional hemisphere after training (p < 0.05). A significant correlation was noted between clinical scales (FMA-UL, ARAT, and WMFT) and EEG fApEn in C3/C4 in the contralesional hemisphere (p < 0.05). This finding suggests that the increase in EEG fApEn could be an estimator of the variance in upper limb motor function improvement. In summary, fApEn can be used to identify abnormal EEG complexity in chronic stroke, when used with BCI-motor observation training. Moreover, these findings based on the fApEn of EEG signals also expand the existing interpretation of training-induced functional improvement in stroke subjects. The entropy-based analysis might serve as a novel approach to understanding the abnormal cortical dynamics of stroke and the neurological changes induced by rehabilitation training. © 2017 Sun, Wong, Wang and Tong.",0.3535031847133758
Nucleus accumbens shell moderates preference bias during voluntary choice behavior,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031787667&doi=10.1093%2fscan%2fnsx072&partnerID=40&md5=b731032d4960ead39092f529145d7b0f,"The nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell lies anatomically at a critical intersection within the brain's reward system circuitry, however, its role in voluntary choice behavior remains unclear. Rats with electrolytic lesions in the NAc shell were tested in a novel foraging paradigm. Over a continuous two-week period they freely chose among four nutritionally identical but differently flavored food pellets by pressing corresponding levers. We examined the lesion's effects on three behavioral dynamics components: motivation (when to eat), preference bias (what to choose) and persistence (how long to repeat the same choice). The lesion led to a marked increase in the preference bias: i.e., increased selection of the most-preferred choice option, and decreased selection of the others. We found no effects on any other behavioral measures, suggesting no effect on motivation or choice persistence. The results implicate the NAc shell in moderating the instrumental valuation process by inhibiting excessive bias toward preferred choice options. © The Author (2017).",0.5
Association between habenula dysfunction and motivational symptoms in unmedicated major depressive disorder,2017,53,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031825892&doi=10.1093%2fscan%2fnsx074&partnerID=40&md5=b3c9db2af1b7605c799c2b3957011e00,"The lateral habenula plays a central role in reward and punishment processing and has been suggested to drive the cardinal symptom of anhedonia in depression. This hypothesis is largely based on observations of habenula hypermetabolism in animal models of depression, but the activity of habenula and its relationship with clinical symptoms in patients with depression remains unclear. High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modelling were used to investigate the activity of the habenula during a probabilistic reinforcement learning task with rewarding and punishing outcomes in 21 unmedicated patients with major depression and 17 healthy participants. High-resolution anatomical scans were also acquired to assess group differences in habenula volume. Healthy individuals displayed the expected activation in the left habenula during receipt of punishment and this pattern was confirmed in the computational analysis of prediction error processing. In depressed patients, there was a trend towards attenuated left habenula activation to punishment, while greater left habenula activation was associated with more severe depressive symptoms and anhedonia. We also identified greater habenula volume in patients with depression, which was associated with anhedonic symptoms. Habenula dysfunction may contribute to abnormal response to punishment in patients with depression, and symptoms such as anhedonia. © The Author (2017).",0.49748743718592964
Potential impact of geomagnetic field in transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032010088&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00478&partnerID=40&md5=7e060d527a23ff7823e1140c758cf809,"Throughout the long history of various therapeutic trials of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), some TMS protocols have been reported to be clearly effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite promising results from repetitive TMS (rTMS) using low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) for neurodegenerative diseases, the low reproducibility has hampered the clinical applications of rTMS. Here, based on the notion of radical pair mechanism explaining magnetoreception in living organisms, we propose a new perspective that rTMS with controlled geomagnetic field (rTMS-GMF) can be an efficient and reproducible therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, combined consideration of imprinted GMF and/or EMFs in patients’ earlier life may augment the potential efficacy of the rTMSGMF. The investigation of this approach is intriguing and may have a high impact on the technical suitability and clinical application of the rTMS-GMF in the near future. © 2017 Chae and Kim.",0.38461538461538464
Physical exercise promotes novel object recognition memory in spontaneously hypertensive rats after ischemic stroke by promoting neural plasticity in the entorhinal cortex,2017,22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041960737&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00185&partnerID=40&md5=450194cbfde37722f0e8238b028d650e,"Cerebral ischemia leads to memory impairment, and several studies have indicated that physical exercise (PE) has memory-improving effects after ischemia. This study was designed to further explore the specific role of PE in novel object recognition (NOR) memory after stroke and the exact cortical regions in which memory is restored by PE. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) or sham surgery, followed by 26 days of PE starting on day 3 post-tMCAO. Thereafter, infarct volume, neurobehavioral outcome and NOR memory were assessed. Immunofluorescence staining and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining were performed in the prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex and corpus callosum regions. Western blot analysis was performed to detect expressions of Nestin, Bcl-2 and SYN proteins in the entorhinal cortex. After tMCAO, NOR memory impairment was found in SHR. Rats subjected to PE post-tMCAO showed increased discrimination ratio, as well as significant decreases in infarct volumes and modified neurological severity scores (mNSS), when compared with tMCAO rats without PE. After stroke, NeuN-positive cell number was drastically reduced in the entorhinal cortex, rather than in the prefrontal cortex. Ischemic stroke had no impact on myelin and phospholipids, and the ratio of SMI-32/MBP in the corpus callosum. PE increased NeuN, Nestin, Ki67, MBP, SYN, PSD-95 and Bcl-2 expressions in the entorhinal cortex, while TUNEL and SMI-32 expressions were decreased. In conclusion, the NOR memory-improving capacity promoted by PE was closely related to neuronal cell proliferation and synaptic plasticity of the entorhinal cortex. © 2017 Pan, Jiang, Zhang, Zheng, Luo and Hu.",0.4007936507936508

Tracking scientific articles published by 111 scholars in the research field of human resource management from the top 8 American universities, we analyze scholars' scientific co-author networks. The result indicates that tie stability changes the teams' information processing modes and, when graphed, results in an inverted U-shape relationship between tie stability and team knowledge creation. Moreover, structural holes in co-author network are proved to be harmful to team knowledge sharing and diffusion, thereby impeding team knowledge creation. Also, tie stability and structural hole interactively influence team knowledge creation. When the number of structural hole is low in the co-author network, the graphical representation of the relationship between tie stability and team knowledge creation tends to be a more distinct U-shape. © 2017 Li, Zhuang, Liu and Zhang.",0.3878787878787879
The effect of dual-hemisphere transcranial direct current stimulation over the parietal operculum on tactile orientation discrimination,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041966956&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00173&partnerID=40&md5=5644bd76a35bc2a708ba85e0d09cd67f,"The parietal operculum (PO) often shows ipsilateral activation during tactile object perception in neuroimaging experiments. However, the relative contribution of the PO to tactile judgment remains unclear. Here, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over bilateral PO to test the relative contributions of the ipsilateral PO to tactile object processing. Ten healthy adults participated in this study, which had a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over design. Participants discriminated grating orientation during three tDCS and sham conditions. In the dual-hemisphere tDCS conditions, anodal and cathodal electrodes were placed over the left and right PO. In the uni-hemisphere tDCS condition, anodal and cathodal electrodes were applied over the left PO and contralateral orbit, respectively. In the tDCS and sham conditions, we applied 2 mA for 15 min and for 15 s, respectively. Computational models of electric fields (EFs) during tDCS indicated that the strongest electric fields were located in regions in and around the PO. Compared with the sham condition, dual-hemisphere tDCS improved the discrimination threshold of the index finger contralateral to the anodal electrode. Importantly, dual-hemisphere tDCS with the anodal electrode over the left PO yielded a decreased threshold in the right finger compared with the uni-hemisphere tDCS condition. These results suggest that the ipsilateral PO inhibits tactile processing of grating orientation, indicating interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) of the PO. © 2017 Fujimoto, Tanaka, Laakso, Yamaguchi, Kon, Nakayama, Kondo and Kitada.",0.40707964601769914
Influence of concurrent finger movements on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-induced aftereffects,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041962910&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00169&partnerID=40&md5=ba934cf94d53cf7ca6c443c8f0133e2f,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to have bidirectional influence on the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in resting participants in a polarity-specific manner: anodal tDCS increased and cathodal tDCS decreased them. More recently, the effects of tDCS have been shown to depend on a number of additional factors. We investigated whether a small variety of movements involving target and non-target muscles could differentially modify the efficacy of tDCS. MEPs were elicited from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle, defined as the target muscle, by single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1). During M1 tDCS, which lasted for 10 min applying anodal, cathodal, or sham condition, the participants were instructed to squeeze a ball with their right hand (Task 1), to move their right index finger only in the medial (Task 2), in the lateral direction (Task 3), or in medial and lateral direction alternatively (Task 4). Anodal tDCS reduced MEP amplitudes measured in Task 1 and Task 2, but to a lesser extent in the latter. In Task 3, anodal tDCS led to greater MEP amplitudes than cathodal stimulation. Alternating movements resulted in no effect of tDCS on MEP amplitude (Task 4). The results are congruent with the current notion that the aftereffects of tDCS are highly variable relying on a number of factors including the type of movements executed during stimulation. © 2017 Shirota, Terney, Antal and Paulus.",0.38495575221238937

The neural basis for these disparate manifestations is not well-understood, however. This study comprehensively investigated the altered functional connectivity patterns of these two subtypes. Twenty-five tremor-dominant patients, 25 akinetic-rigid patients and 26 normal control subjects participated in this study. Resting-state functional MRI data were analyzed using functional connectivity density (FCD) and seed-based functional connectivity approaches. Correlations between neuroimaging measures and clinical variables were also calculated. Compared with normal control, increased global FCD occurred most extensively in frontal lobe and cerebellum in both subtypes. Compared with akinetic-rigid patients, the tremor-dominant patients showed significantly increased global FCD in the cerebellum and decreased global FCD in portions of the bilateral frontal lobe. Furthermore, different subtypes demonstrated different cerebello-cortical functional connectivity patterns. Moreover, the identified FCD and functional connectivity correlated significantly with clinical variables in the PD patients, and particularly the FCD indices distinguished the different subtypes with high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (80%). These findings indicate that the functional connectivity patterns in the cerebellum and frontal lobe are altered in both subtypes of PD, especially cerebellum are highly related to tremor. © 2017 Hu, Jiang, Jiang, Zhang, Liang, Li, Zhang, Yao, Luo and Wang.

Intranasal oxytocin treatment increases eye-gaze behavior toward the owner in ancient Japanese dog breeds,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029696887&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01624&partnerID=40&md5=09075dd2eff416ec3244fd90845f6efd,"Dogs acquired unique cognitive abilities during domestication, which is thought to have contributed to the formation of the human-dog bond. In European breeds, but not in wolves, a dog's gazing behavior plays an important role in affiliative interactions with humans and stimulates oxytocin secretion in both humans and dogs, which suggests that this interspecies oxytocin and gaze-mediated bonding was also acquired during domestication. In this study, we investigated whether Japanese breeds, which are classified as ancient breeds and are relatively close to wolves genetically, establish a bond with their owners through gazing behavior. The subject dogs were treated with either oxytocin or saline before the starting of the behavioral testing. We also evaluated physiological changes in the owners during mutual gazing by analyzing their heart rate variability (HRV) and subsequent urinary oxytocin levels in both dogs and their owners. We found that oxytocin treatment enhanced the gazing behavior of Japanese dogs and increased their owners' urinary oxytocin levels, as was seen with European breeds; however, the measured durations of skin contact and proximity to their owners were relatively low. In the owners' HRV readings, inter-beat (R-R) intervals (RRI), the standard deviation of normal to normal inter-beat (R-R) intervals (SDNN), and the root mean square of successive heartbeat interval differences (RMSSD) were lower when the dogs were treated with oxytocin compared with saline. Furthermore, the owners of female dogs showed lower SDNN than the owners of male dogs. These results suggest that the owners of female Japanese dogs exhibit more tension during interactions, and apart from gazing behavior, the dogs may show sex differences in their interactions with humans as well. They also suggest that Japanese dogs use eye-gazing as an attachment behavior toward humans similar to European breeds; however, there is a disparity between the dog sexes when it comes to the owners' oxytocin secretion. Japanese dogs also showed different attachment behaviors from both European breeds and wolves, and they likely use additional strategies to substitute gaze when forming the human-dog bond. © 2017 Nagasawa, Ogawa, Mogi and Kikusui.",0.32344213649851633

Our research in rural China about husbands’ and wives’ perceptions of household decision making and gender-related attitudes examines hypotheses derived from Connell’s theory of gender structures using the Gansu Survey of Children and Families. Consistent with previous research, we find that both migrant husbands and their wives perceive that women have more decision-making power over household production and consumption. In contrast, the effects of husbands’ migration on gender attitudes are not uniformly positive. Both migrant husbands and their wives are more likely than nonmigrant spouses to agree that women and men can achieve the same given equal opportunities. Moreover, migrant husbands hold more gender egalitarian views toward their children’s education than nonmigrant husbands. However, migrant husbands and their wives are no more likely to question sons’ obligations or men’s and women’s roles in the family than their nonmigrant counterparts. We interpret our findings as strategic gender egalitarianism, that is, gender egalitarianism born of necessity, particularly economic necessity. Strategic gender egalitarianism does not, however, challenge dominant gender structures that define family relationships and allocate power unequally. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.",0.44041450777202074

Recent research on the effectiveness of self-help internet-based CBT (ICBT) indicates that the paradigm moderately improves psychological problems. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that food and drinks containing supplements improve various health conditions. We investigated the effect of a brief self-help ICBT administered with a supplement drink on psychological well-being and somatic symptoms. Methods: In total, 101 healthy workers were enrolled in the 4-week ICBT program, which consisted of psychoeducation on stress management, behavior activation, and cognitive restructuring. The supplement soft drink was taken every day during the program. The participants were instructed to watch on-demand video clips and read the self-help guidebook and supporting comic strip weekly on the Internet or smartphone. The Japanese version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) was administered before and after completion of the program. Scores on the POMS tension-anxiety (POMS-TA), depression (POMS-D), and fatigue (POMS-F) subscales were used to assess the effect of the program. Somatic symptoms were assessed using the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. Results: In total, 75 participants continued the program for 4 weeks; however, of those, 27 failed to complete all weekly tasks or meet the post-assessment deadlines. Therefore, the data of 48 participants were included in the analysis. Pre-post intervention comparisons using paired t-tests revealed significant improvement on the POMS-TA, but not the POMS-D or POMS-F subscales. Moreover, participants reported a significant reduction in the severity of low back pain. Conclusion: Our brief intervention moderately improved anxiety levels and the symptom of low back pain. These findings suggest that the brief ICBT program is effective in non-patient populations. Future directions for brief ICBT are discussed.

Accumulated data from laboratory studies show that positive and negative interpretation styles with accompanying changes in mood can be induced through cognitive bias modification (CBM) paradigms. Despite the therapeutic potential of positive training effects, few studies have explored training paradigms administered via smartphones. The current study aimed to compare the effectiveness of three different types of training programmes (cognitive bias modification-attention, CBM-A; cognitive bias modification-interpretation, CBM-I; attention and interpretation modification, AIM) administered via smart-phones by using a control condition (CC). Methods: Seventy-six undergraduate participants with high social anxiety (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, LSAS ≥ 30) were randomly assigned to four groups: CBM-A (n = 20), CBM-I (n = 20), AIM (n = 16), and CC (n = 20). Results: The results showed that the effects of CBM training, CBM-I training, or AIM training vs. CC for attention yielded no significant differences in dot-probe attention bias scores.

Conclusions: The present results supported the feasibility of delivering CBM-I via smartphones, but the effectiveness of CBM-A and AIM training via smartphones was limited. © 2017 Yang, Cui, Li, Xiao, Zhang and Oei.",0.4577114427860697
Understanding the trait basis of career adaptability: A two-wave mediation analysis among Chinese university students,2017,44,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018448070&doi=10.1016%2fj.jvb.2017.04.004&partnerID=40&md5=d133c5e657112a79b6a0354de2c8937c,"To investigate the mechanisms through which the basic traits (big-five personality and approach/avoidance traits) predict career adaptability, and develop a more systematic view of the components of career adaptivity, we conducted a two-wave survey study among 206 Chinese university students. Drawing on career construction theory and the distal-proximal framework of motivation, we incorporated core self-evaluation (CSE), proactive personality and learning goal orientation (LGO) as the key mediators and tested their relations with basic traits and career adaptability. It was found that these dispositional predictors (measured at Time 1) account for 43% (adjusted R2) of the variance in career adaptability (measured at Time 2). In addition, CSE mediates the effects of conscientiousness, neuroticism, approach and avoidance traits on career adaptability; LGO and proactive personality mediate the effects of openness to experience, conscientiousness as well as approach trait on career adaptability. When the three mediators (CSE, LGO and proactive personality) are put into the model, only extraversion has a remaining direct effect on career adaptability. Implications of the findings are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.5449101796407185

A Validity and Reliability Study of the Japanese Version of the Geriatric Depression Scale 15 (GDS-15-J),2017,135,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84980319993&doi=10.1080%2f07317115.2016.1199452&partnerID=40&md5=5926430787cd854dcc7c971de3acc3f3,"Objective: The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) is one of the most widely used screening instruments for depression among the elderly. The aim of this study was to examine the validity and reliability of the Japanese version of the GDS-15 (GDS-15-J) in comparison with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for depression. Methods: The study participants were 128 elderly outpatients (age range, 55 to 92 years) categorized into two groups (76 non-depressive patients, 52 depressive patients) based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria for depression. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that regardless of age and sex, the GDS-15-J score could be used to screen patients for depression (p <.001). The validity of the GDS-15-J for depression assessed against DSM-IV-TR criteria was excellent based on receiver operating characteristic analysis (optimal cutoff point: 6/7; sensitivity:.98; specificity:.86). The recommended optimal cutoff score when screening for depression is 6/7. To evaluate the constructive validity of the GDS-15-J, factor analysis was performed. Three factors were extracted. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient was.83 to the GDS-15-J scale, which indicated a high degree of internal consistency. Conclusion: The GDS-15-J is a clinically applicable screening instrument for depression. Clinical Implications: In this study this version of the GDS-15-J displayed excellent psychometric properties using a 6/7 cut off. Analyses suggest some items that might be removed in future studies of an abbreviated scale. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0.4375

Unlike static text reading, little is known about the basic characteristics underlying reading dynamically presented texts. Two experiments were performed to investigate this. Experiment 1 examined the optimum rate of dynamic text presentation in terms of a readability and favorability. This experiment demonstrated that, when the rate of text presentation was changed, there was an optimum presentation rate (around 6 letters/s in our condition) regardless of difficulty level. This indicates that the presentation rate of dynamic texts can affect the impression of reading. In Experiment 2, to elucidate the traits underlying dynamic text reading, we measured the reading speeds of silent and trace reading among the same participants and compared them with the optimum presentation rate obtained in Experiment 1. The results showed that the optimum rate was slower than with silent reading and faster than with trace reading, and, interestingly, the individual optimum rates of dynamic text presentation were correlated with the speeds of both silent and trace reading. In other words, the readers who preferred a fast rate in dynamic text presentation would also have a high reading speed for silent and trace reading. © 2017 Uetsuki, Watanabe, Ando and Maruya.",0.4252336448598131

They also reported on their ethnic identity, intergroup relations, and perceived school safety. Results showed that same-ethnic friendships were related to stronger ethnic identity and interracial friendships were uniquely related to school safety. Interethnic friendships (an Asian friend from a different country of origin) when perceived as same ethnic functioned similarly to same-ethnic friendships, whereas interethnic friendships perceived as from a different ethnic group, like interracial friendships, were associated with better intergroup relations.

Using a within-participants design, young adult participants performed a memory-encoding task while performing a cycling exercise or being seated. The subsequent retrieval phase was conducted while sitting on a chair. We assessed behavioral and event-related brain potential measures of familiarity and recollection processes during the retrieval phase. Results indicated that source accuracy was lower for encoding with exercise than for encoding in the resting condition. Event-related brain potential measures indicated that the parietal old/new effect, which has been linked to recollection processing, was observed in the exercise condition, whereas it was absent in the rest condition, which is indicative of exercise-induced hippocampal activation. These findings suggest that aerobic exercise during encoding impairs hippocampusdependent memory, which may be attributed to inefficient source encoding during aerobic exercise. © 2017 Human Kinetics, Inc.",0.48344370860927155
Hard Lessons: Why Rational Number Arithmetic Is So Difficult for So Many People,2017,37,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027228514&doi=10.1177%2f0963721417700129&partnerID=40&md5=fbd0dd4b559b1f08d6877a0eb1f6c3cc,"Fraction and decimal arithmetic pose large difficulties for many children and adults. This is a serious problem because proficiency with these skills is crucial for learning more advanced mathematics and science and for success in many occupations. This review identifies two main classes of difficulties that underlie poor understanding of rational number arithmetic: inherent and culturally contingent. Inherent sources of difficulty are ones that are imposed by the task of learning rational number arithmetic, such as complex relations among fraction arithmetic operations. They are present for all learners. Culturally contingent sources of difficulty are ones that vary among cultures, such as teacher understanding of rational numbers. They lead to poorer learning among students in some places rather than others. We conclude by discussing interventions that can improve learning of rational number arithmetic. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.5223880597014925
Using a feedback environment to improve creative performance: A dynamic affect perspective,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027558584&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01398&partnerID=40&md5=236e36c9c720391e84c12e93c707829a,"Prior research on feedback and creative performance has neglected the dynamic nature of affect and has focused only on the influence of positive affect. We argue that creative performance is the result of a dynamic process in which a person experiences a phase of negative affect and subsequently enters a state of high positive affect that is influenced by the feedback environment. Hierarchical regression was used to analyze a sample of 264 employees from seven industry firms. The results indicate that employees' perceptions of a supportive supervisor feedback environment indirectly influence their level of creative performance through positive affect (t2); the negative affect (t1) moderates the relationship between positive affect (t2) and creative performance (t2), rendering the relationship more positive if negative affect (t1) is high. The change in positive affect mediates the relationship between the supervisor feedback environment and creative performance; a decrease in negative affect moderates the relationship between increased positive affect and creative performance, rendering the relationship more positive if the decrease in negative affect is large. The implications for improving the creative performances of employees are further discussed. © 2017 Gong and Zhang.",0.5706521739130435

Specifically, it was hypothesized that the relationship between psychological well-being and negative academic emotions is moderated by cognitive reappraisal. A total of 311 migrant adolescents aged 14-20 years were selected, including 132 boys and 179 girls. Results of a regression analysis showed that cognitive reappraisal (positive) and negative academic emotions were significant predictors of psychological well-being. The interaction effect between cognitive reappraisal and negative academic emotion was also a significant predictor of psychological well-being. In the simple slope analysis the group with a below average cognitive reappraisal score the negative academic emotions were associated with lower psychological well-being, whereas in the group with above average cognitive reappraisal the effect of negative academic emotions on psychological well-being was not significant. However, for those with a cognitive reappraisal score of 1 standard deviation above the average, the effect of negative academic emotions on psychological well-being was not significant. These results suggest that cognitive reappraisal was a significant moderator in the relationship between negative academic emotion and psychological well-being. © 2017 Wang, Li, Hu, Dong and Tao.",0.41232227488151657

This study utilised functional connectivity density (FCD), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and discriminant analyses to investigate impairments in self- and ToM-related networks in patients with SAD. Patients with SAD exhibited decreased long-range FCD in the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and decreased short-range FCD in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG)-key nodes involved in self- and ToM-processing, respectively. Decreased RSFC of the right rACC and STG with widespread frontal, temporal, posteromedial, sensorimotor, and somatosensory, regions was also observed in patients with SAD. Altered RSFC between the right rACC and bilateral superior frontal gyrus, between the right rACC and right middle frontal gyrus, and within the right STG itself provided the greatest contribution to individual diagnoses of SAD, with an accuracy of 84.5%. These results suggest that a lack of cognitive inhibition on emotional self-referential processing as well as impairments in social information integration may play critical roles in the pathomechanism of SAD and highlight the importance of recognising such features in the diagnosis and treatment of SAD. © The Author (2017).",0.3838383838383838

However, its nature and its correlation with simple number representation remain elusive, especially at the theoretical level. To fill this gap, we propose a gain-field model of proportion representation to shed light on the neural and computational basis of proportion representation. The model is based on two well-supported neuroscientific findings. The first, gain modulation, is a general mechanism for information integration in the brain; the second relevant finding is how simple quantity is neurally represented. Based on these principles, the model accounts for recent relevant proportion representation data at both behavioral and neural levels. The model further addresses two key computational problems for the cognitive processing of proportions: invariance and generalization. Finally, the model provides pointers for future empirical testing. © 2017 Chen and Verguts.",0.4772727272727273
Purging behaviors relate to impaired subjective sleep quality in female patients with anorexia nervosa: A prospective observational study,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027461911&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0107-7&partnerID=40&md5=03b40963337edd038fe546d646d00848,"Background: We examined how purging behaviors relate to subjective sleep quality and sleep patterns and how symptoms of disordered eating behaviors relate to global sleep quality in female patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). Methods: Participants were new consecutive female inpatients with a primary diagnosis of AN admitted to the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine at Kohnodai Hospital between June 26 and December 25, 2015. We recorded patients' habitual eating behaviors, laxative overuse, or uretic misuse, and administered the Japanese versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-J) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Raw PSQI-J data were used to determine sleep patterns (sleep-onset time, wake-up time, and sleep duration). To examine how purging behaviors related to sleep quality, we compared variables between AN restricting type (ANr) and AN binge-eating/purging type (ANbp). Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to examine which potential factors influence global PSQI-J score. Results: Participants were 20 patients, of whom 12 had ANbp. Two ANr patients (25%) had global PSQI-J scores greater than 5, compared to 9 ANbp patients (75%; P < 0.05). Circadian rhythm disruption and abnormal sleep duration were significantly greater in ANbp patients than in ANr patients (P < 0.05). Global PSQI-J was significantly correlated with a diagnosis of ANbp (Ρ = 0.525; P < 0.05), vomiting (Ρ = 0.561; P < 0.05), and duration of illness (Ρ = 0.536; P < 0.05). Conclusions: ANbp patients had worse global sleep quality and greater disrupted sleep than did ANr patients. This suggests that treatments focusing on sleep would be useful, especially for ANbp patients. Furthermore, vomiting and duration of illness should be considered essential factors related to impaired global sleep quality.

Participants learned which given enterobacteria caused a negative or a positive effect on gastrointestinal conditions. Subsequently, they were asked to evaluate learned cues and novel cues in which distinctive elements were added to or removed from the enterobacteria. The results generally demonstrated that relatedness between the elements and outcomes, such as negative features combined with a negative outcome or positive features combined with a positive outcome, resulted in asymmetrical generalization patterns. By contrast, unrelated combinations, such as positive features and a negative outcome, produced symmetrical patterns of generalization.

Treating anxiety in the context of BD is crucial for improving illness course and outcomes. The current study examined the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the Unified Protocol (UP), a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy, as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for BD and comorbid anxiety disorders. Methods Twenty-nine patients with BD and at least one comorbid anxiety disorder were randomized to pharmacotherapy treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU with 18 sessions of the UP (UP+TAU). All patients completed assessments every four weeks to track symptoms, functioning, emotion regulation and temperament. Linear mixed-model regressions were conducted to track symptom changes over time and to examine the relationship between emotion-related variables and treatment response. Results Satisfaction ratings were equivalent for both treatment groups. Patients in the UP+TAU group evidenced significantly greater reductions over time in anxiety and depression symptoms (Cohen's d's>0.80). Baseline levels of neuroticism, perceived affective control, and emotion regulation ability predicted magnitude of symptom change for the UP+TAU group only. Greater change in perceived control of emotions and emotion regulation skills predicted greater change in anxiety related symptoms. Limitations This was a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial; results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions Treatment with the UP+TAU was rated high in patient satisfaction, and resulted in significantly greater improvement on indices of anxiety and depression relative to TAU. This suggests that the UP may be a feasible treatment approach for BD with comorbid anxiety. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.5118110236220472

The current study explored this modulation during pre-attentive L2 orthographic perception. ERPs were recorded from Chinese–English bilinguals with different L2 proficiency during their pre-attentive response to deviant and standard stimuli arranged in the oddball paradigm. Two stimulus types were investigated separately: L2 orthography and L1 orthography. In the L2 orthography condition, a MMN-N400 complex (i.e., deviancy effect) was found in the high L2 proficiency bilinguals, but only a marginally significant reduced negativity in an early time window was found in the low L2 proficiency bilinguals. In the L1 orthography condition, the high and low L2 proficiency bilinguals showed similar deviancy effect in the form of MMN-P3a-LPC complex. The current findings suggest that proficiency modulates pre-attentive L2 orthographic perception, such that the high L2 proficiency bilinguals activate the associated semantic representation instantly upon orthographic decoding, while the orthographic-semantic connection is not activated for the low L2 proficiency bilinguals. This is probably due to their difference in the strength of orthographic-semantic association. These findings contribute to the understanding of orthographic processing by bilinguals at the pre-attentive level and provide supporting evidence for the BIA-d model. © 2017 Liang, Sharwood Smith, Chondrogianni and Chen.",0.44036697247706424

In Experiment 1, infants were exposed to a live tutor, while in Experiment 2, another group of infants were exposed to a televised tutor. Results indicate that both younger and older infants were capable of segmenting a word and learning a word–object association only when the stimuli were derived from a live tutor in a natural manner, suggesting that real-life interaction enhances the learning of spoken words in preverbal infants. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.4375

Participants were scanned while performing a passive viewing task before training, after 4-day training and after 12-day training. Results showed that pattern similarity in the left pars opercularis (PO) and fusiform gyrus (FG) before training was negatively associated with reaction time (RT) in both word naming and picture naming tasks after training.

The question of how structural connectivity constrains the “variability” of functional connectivity remains unresolved. In this study, we investigated the variability of resting state functional connectivity that was acquired every 3 h within a single day from 12 participants (eight time sessions within a 24-h period, 165 scans per session). Three different types of functional connectivity (functional connectivity based on Pearson correlation, direct functional connectivity based on partial correlation, and the pseudo functional connectivity produced by their difference) were estimated from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data along with structural connectivity defined using fiber tractography of diffusion tensor imaging. Those types of functional connectivity were evaluated with regard to properties of structural connectivity (fiber streamline counts and lengths) and types of structural connectivity such as intra-/inter-hemispheric edges and topological edge types in the rich club organization. We observed that the structural connectivity constrained the variability of direct functional connectivity more than pseudo-functional connectivity and that the constraints depended strongly on structural connectivity types. The structural constraints were greater for intra-hemispheric and heterologous inter-hemispheric edges than homologous inter-hemispheric edges, and feeder and local edges than rich club edges in the rich club architecture. While each edge was highly variable, the multivariate patterns of edge involvement, especially the direct functional connectivity patterns among the rich club brain regions, showed low variability over time. This study suggests that structural connectivity not only constrains the strength of functional connectivity, but also the within-a-day variability of functional connectivity and connectivity patterns, particularly the direct functional connectivity among brain regions. © 2017 Park, Eo and Park.",0.5241379310344828

Our first study explores how dispositional fear and anger influence risk preferences through a classic virtual “Asia Disease Problem” task and the second study investigates how induced fear and anger influence risk preferences through an incentive-compatible task. Consistent with previous research, our results reveal that induced fear and anger have differential effects on risky decisions: angry participants prefer the risk-seeking option, whereas fearful participants prefer a risk-averse option. However, we find no associations between dispositional fear (or anger) and risky decisions. © 2017 She, Eimontaite, Zhang and Sun.",0.5406976744186046
How disentangled sense of agency and sense of ownership can interact with different emotional events on stress feelings,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038035872&doi=10.1186%2fs41155-017-0071-y&partnerID=40&md5=53fb1b4450574323041f3b27d337725b,"We used the virtual hand illusion paradigm to study how sense of agency and sense of (body) ownership can interact with different emotional events on stress feelings. Converging evidence for at least the partial independence of agency and ownership was found. For instance, sense of agency was a better predictor of individual anxiety levels than sense of ownership and males showed stronger effects related to agency-presumably due to gender-specific attribution styles and empathy skills. Moreover, agency and ownership also interacted with emotional events and led to different anxiety levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that the disentangled sense of agency and sense of ownership can interact with different emotional events and influenced stress feelings more in threatening situations than awarding ones. © The Author(s). 2017.",0.4634146341463415
Negative affect during a collective (but not an individual) task is associated with holistic attention in East Asian cultural context,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026804034&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01283&partnerID=40&md5=b29224b36f384ebac79bc27f210f8c7e,"Previous studies have suggested that individuals from East Asian cultures are more likely to show holistic attention-a pattern of attention that incorporates contextual information into focal stimuli-than individuals from North American cultures. Holistic attention is also prevalent in communities that require close cooperation. However, it is not yet known how cooperation is related to holistic attention. We theorized that holistic attention increases when people experience negative affect (e.g., worry, sadness, and frustration) during collective tasks (but not during individual tasks) because negative affect in social contexts signals the existence of potential threats to social harmony, thus indicating a need to restore social harmony. To examine this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted in which participants performed a musical duet either with another participant (a collective task requiring cooperation), or individually with a computer (an individual task). After the musical task, the Framed Line Task (FLT) was administered to examine their holistic attention. Participants also reported their emotional states both before and after the music task. Results suggested that negative affect in the collective task-but not the individual task-was positively correlated with a holistic pattern of attention. The function of negative affect in social contexts as motivation to restore relationships and how this enhances holistic attention is discussed. The moderating effect of social context on the link between negative affect and cognition is also discussed. © 2017 Tominaga, Uchida, Miyamoto and Yamasaki.",0.4649122807017544

Yet, emerging evidence provides support for a relationship in the opposite direction, suggesting that career exploration may also be an antecedent. Using a cross-lagged panel design, we empirically tested the reciprocal relationship between future work self and career exploration. In Study 1, we measured both future work self and career exploration at two time points with an 8-week lag among 133 Chinese university students. Results showed that future work self and career exploration are reciprocally related over time. In Study 2 (N = 228), with a longer time lag (12 weeks), results showed that career exploration (Time 1) is significantly related to future work self (Time 3), but not vice versa. Moreover, career adaptability (measured in week 8, Time 2) mediates the reciprocal effects between future work self and career exploration.

Consequently, empirical evidence on links among children's attachment, empathy, and prosociality is thin and inconsistent. We examined such links in 2 longitudinal studies of community families (Family Study, N = 101 mothers, fathers, and children, 14 to 80 months; Parent-Child Study, mothers and children, N = 108, 15 to 45 months) and a study of low-income, diverse mothers and toddlers (Play Study, N = 186, 30 months). Children's security was assessed in Strange Situation in infancy and rated by observers and mothers using Attachment Q-Set at toddler age. Children's empathy was observed in scripted probes that involved parental simulated distress. Children's prosociality was rated by parents (Family Study, Play Study). Security with mothers related to higher empathy. For mother- and father- child dyads, security moderated the path from empathy to prosociality. For insecure children, but not secure ones, variations in empathy related to prosociality. Insecure and unempathic children were particularly low in prosociality. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.5
"Individual differences in the speed of facial emotion recognition show little specificity but are strongly related with general mental speed: Psychometric, neural and genetic evidence",2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027837712&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00149&partnerID=40&md5=b47e800790edf88e4b09dcaea5e8d461,"Facial identity and facial expression processing are crucial socio-emotional abilities but seem to show only limited psychometric uniqueness when the processing speed is considered in easy tasks. We applied a comprehensive measurement of processing speed and contrasted performance specificity in socio-emotional, social and non-social stimuli from an individual differences perspective. Performance in a multivariate task battery could be best modeled by a general speed factor and a first-order factor capturing some specific variance due to processing emotional facial expressions. We further tested equivalence of the relationships between speed factors and polymorphisms of dopamine and serotonin transporter genes. Results show that the speed factors are not only psychometrically equivalent but invariant in their relation with the Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism. However, the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 serotonin polymorphism was related with the first-order factor of emotion perception speed, suggesting a specific genetic correlate of processing emotions. We further investigated the relationship between several components of event-related brain potentials with psychometric abilities, and tested emotion specific individual differences at the neurophysiological level. Results revealed swifter emotion perception abilities to go along with larger amplitudes of the P100 and the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), when emotion processing was modeled on its own. However, after partialling out the shared variance of emotion perception speed with general processing speed-related abilities, brain-behavior relationships did not remain specific for emotion. Together, the present results suggest that speed abilities are strongly interrelated but show some specificity for emotion processing speed at the psychometric level. At both genetic and neurophysiological levels, emotion specificity depended on whether general cognition is taken into account or not. These findings keenly suggest that general speed abilities should be taken into account when the study of emotion recognition abilities is targeted in its specificity. © 2017 Liu, Hildebrandt, Recio, Sommer, Cai and Wilhelm.",0.4217687074829932
Quantitative susceptibility mapping reveals an association between brain iron load and depression severity,2017,30,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032017415&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00442&partnerID=40&md5=cc61df88e8cc05f31c960ae5675e1de2,"Previous studies have detected abnormal serum ferritin levels in patients with depression; however, the results have been inconsistent. This study used quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) for the first time to examine brain iron concentration in depressed patients and evaluated whether it is related to severity. We included three groups of age- and gender-matched participants: 30 patients with mild-moderate depression (MD), 14 patients with major depression disorder (MDD) and 20 control subjects. All participants underwent MR scans with a 3D gradient-echo sequence reconstructing for QSM and performed the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) test. In MDD, the susceptibility value in the bilateral putamen was significantly increased compared with MD or control subjects. In addition, a significant difference was also observed in the left thalamus in MDD patients compared with controls. However, the susceptibility values did not differ between MD patients and controls. The susceptibility values positively correlated with the severity of depression as indicated by the HDRS scores. Our results provide evidence that brain iron deposition may be associated with depression and may even be a biomarker for investigating the pathophysiological mechanism of depression. © 2017 Yao, Zhong, Xu, Qin, Zhang, Zhu and Li.",0.47619047619047616
Self-esteem modulates the P3 component in response to the self-face processing after priming with emotional faces,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027710367&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01399&partnerID=40&md5=872c2b636704ddd3719db9ce9292ecf0,"The self-face processing advantage (SPA) refers to the research finding that individuals generally recognize their own face faster than another's face; self-face also elicits an enhanced P3 amplitude compared to another's face. It has been suggested that social evaluation threats could weaken the SPA and that self-esteem could be regarded as a threat buffer. However, little research has directly investigated the neural evidence of how self-esteem modulates the social evaluation threat to the SPA. In the current event-related potential study, 27 healthy Chinese undergraduate students were primed with emotional faces (angry, happy, or neutral) and were asked to judge whether the target face (self, friend, and stranger) was familiar or unfamiliar. Electrophysiological results showed that after priming with emotional faces (angry and happy), self-face elicited similar P3 amplitudes to friend-face in individuals with low self-esteem, but not in individuals with high self-esteem. The results suggest that as low self-esteem raises fears of social rejection and exclusion, priming with emotional faces (angry and happy) can weaken the SPA in low self-esteem individuals but not in high self-esteem individuals. © 2017 Guan, Zhao, Wang, Chen and Yang.",0.42857142857142855
Action direction of muscle synergies in voluntary multi-directional postural control,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032015990&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00434&partnerID=40&md5=54e09f5354e2af3989c8bf2cf6c89231,"A muscle synergy is a coordinative structure of muscles that has been proposed as a strategy to reduce the number of variables that the central nervous system (CNS) has to address in motor tasks. In this article, the mechanical contribution of muscle synergies and coordinative structures of muscles in voluntary multi-directional postural control were investigated. The task for healthy, young subjects was to shift and align their center of pressure (COP) to targets dispersed in 12 different directions in the horizontal plane by leaning their bodies for 10 s. Electromyograms (EMGs) of 18 muscles and COPs were recorded in the experiment. Muscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), and the structure of coordinative modules to keep the posture leaning toward various directions was disclosed. Then the directional properties, such as the mechanical role (i.e., action directions, we use ADs as abbreviation below), of muscle synergies and muscles were estimated using an electromyogram weighted averaging (EWA) method, which is based on a cross-correlation between the fluctuations in the activation of muscle synergies and the COP. The results revealed that the ADs of muscle synergies were almost uniformly distributed in the task space in most of the subjects, which indicates that mechanical characteristics reduce the redundancy in postural control. In terms of the composition of muscle synergies and the ADs of individual muscles, we confirmed that muscle synergies in multi-directional postural control comprised a combination of several muscles, including various ADs, that generate torque at different joints. © 2017 Kubo, Hagio, Kibushi, Moritani and Kouzaki.",0.408

Altered brain connectivity in the language network has frequently been reported in ASD patients using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) compared to typically developing (TD) participants. Most of these studies have focused on a specific age group or mixed age groups with ASD. In the current study, we investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity related measure, degree centrality (DC), in the language network across three age groups with ASD (113 children, 113 adolescents and 103 adults) using resting-state fMRI data collected from the autism brain imaging data exchange repository. We identified regions with significant group-wise differences between ASD and TD groups for three age cohorts using DC based on graph theory. We found that both children and adolescents with ASD showed decreased DC in Broca’s area compared to age-matched TD groups. Adults with ASD showed decreased DC in Wernicke’s area compared to TD adults. We also observed increased DC in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) for children with ASD compared to TD children and for adults with ASD compared to TD adults, respectively. Overall, functional differences occurred in key language processing regions such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) related to language production and comprehension across three age cohorts. We explored correlations between DC values of our findings with autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) scores related to severity of ASD symptoms in the ASD group. We found that DC values of the left IFG demonstrated negative correlations with ADOS scores in children and adolescents with ASD. The left STG showed significant negative correlations with ADOS scores in adults with ASD. These results might shed light on the language network regions that should be further explored for prognosis, diagnosis, and monitoring of ASD in three age groups. © 2017 Lee, Park, James, Kim and Park.",0.42356687898089174

In Experiment 1, undergraduates made drawings under three conditions: (a) copying an artist's drawing, then producing an original drawing; (b) producing an original drawing without having seen another's work; and (c) copying another artist's work, then reproducing that artist's style independently. We discovered that through copying unfamiliar abstract drawings, participants were able to produce creative drawings qualitatively different from the model drawings. Process analyses suggested that participants' cognitive constraints became relaxed, and new perspectives were formed from copying another's artwork. Experiment 2 showed that exposure to styles of artwork considered unfamiliar facilitated creativity in drawing, while styles considered familiar did not do so. Experiment 3 showed that both copying and thoroughly viewing artwork executed using an unfamiliar style facilitated creativity in drawing, whereas merely thinking about alternative styles of artistic representation did not do so. These experiments revealed that deep encounters with unfamiliar artworks—whether through copying or prolonged observation—change people's cognitive representations of the act of drawing to produce novel artwork.

Association of perfectionistic and dependent dysfunctional attitudes with subthreshold depression,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027890960&doi=10.2147%2fPRBM.S135912&partnerID=40&md5=95e7901570c7665fd1c3ee2c5e2b57bb,"Background: Dysfunctional attitudes are beliefs and attitudes that induce negative thoughts about the self, others, and the future, leading to depression. Perfectionistic dysfunctional attitudes are beliefs and attitudes about achievement and excessive fear of failure, while dependent dysfunctional attitudes are beliefs and attitudes about dependency on, and approval from, others. Subthreshold depression refers to a depressive state that does not meet the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode. This study examined whether the difference in perfectionistic dysfunctional attitudes between college students with subthreshold depression and those with no depression would be greater than that of dependent dysfunctional attitudes. Methods: Participants were defined as having subthreshold depression if they scored 16 or higher on the Japanese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode, as assessed by the major depressive episode module of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The participants included 21 male and 87 female college students, with a mean age of 20.3 years. Dysfunctional attitudes were evaluated with the Japanese version of the 24-item Dysfunctional Attitude Scale. Results: Of the 108 students, 34 had subthreshold depression while 74 had no depression. The magnitudes of the differences in perfectionistic and dependent dysfunctional attitudes between the students with subthreshold depression and those with no depression were large (Cohen’s d=0.83) and small (Cohen’s d=0.25). Conclusion: The results of this study provide the first evidence that the difference in perfectionistic dysfunctional attitudes between college students with subthreshold depression and those with no depression is greater than that of dependent dysfunctional attitudes. © 2017 Horiuchi et al.",0.41245136186770426

In the MHD task, a participant chooses one of three options where only one contains a reward. After one of the unchosen options (always no reward) is disclosed, the participant is asked to make a final decision: either change to the remaining option or stick with their first choice. Although the probability of winning if they change is higher (2/3) compared to sticking with their first choice (1/3), most people stick with their original selection and often lose. In accordance with previous research, repetitive exposure to the MHD task increases the change behavior without any obvious understanding of the mathematical reasons why changing increases their chance of being rewarded. We recorded the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN), an ERP that might reflect the informative value of the feedback. In the second half of the task, feedback was predicted to be less informative because learning had taken place. Indeed, the SPN amplitude became smaller over the frontal region. Also, the SPN amplitude was larger for change than for stick trials. These results suggest that learning in the MHD might be manifest in affective-motivational anticipation as indicated by the SPN. © 2017 The Authors.

There are five different treatments pertaining to the lottery faced in phase 2: The control treatment (i.e., a standard lottery), the treatment with awareness of unawareness of lottery outcomes but known number of outcomes, the treatment with awareness of unawareness of outcomes but with unknown number of outcomes, the treatment with unawareness of unawareness of some outcomes, and the treatment with an ambiguous lottery.

Regulating anger under stress via cognitive reappraisal and sadness,2017,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027561867&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01372&partnerID=40&md5=ac0fc6cd17a90ff3a80c0c0f507c9ef9,"Previous studies have reported the failure of cognitive emotion regulation (CER), especially in regulating unpleasant emotions under stress. The underlying reason for this failure was the application of CER depends heavily on the executive function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but this function can be impaired by stress-related neuroendocrine hormones. This observation highlights the necessity of developing selfregulatory strategies that require less top-down cognitive control. Based on traditional Chinese philosophy and medicine, which examine how different types of emotions promote or counteract one another, we have developed a novel emotion regulation strategy whereby one emotion is used to alter another. For example, our previous experiment showed that sadness induction (after watching a sad film) could reduce aggressive behavior associated with anger [i.e., “sadness counteracts anger” (SCA)] (Zhan et al., 2015). Relative to the CER strategy requiring someone to think about certain cognitive reappraisals to reinterpret the meaning of an unpleasant situation, watching a film or listening to music and experiencing the emotion contained therein seemingly requires less cognitive effort and control; therefore, this SCA strategy may be an alternative strategy that compensates for the limitations of cognitive regulation strategies, especially in stressful situations. The present study was designed to directly compare the effects of the CER and SCA strategy in regulating anger and anger-related aggression in stressful and non-stressful conditions. Participants' subjective feeling of anger, anger-related aggressive behavior, skin conductance, and salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels were measured. Our findings revealed that acute stress impaired one's ability to use CR to control angry responses provoked by others, whereas stress did not influence the efficiency of the SCA strategy. Compared with sadness or neutral emotion induction, CER induction was found to reduce the level of subjective anger more, but this difference only existed in non-stressful conditions. By contrast, irrespective of stress, the levels of aggressive behavior and related skin conductance after sadness induction were both significantly lower than those after CER induction or neutral emotion induction, thus suggesting the immunity of the regulatory effect of SCA strategy to the stress factor. © 2017 Zhan, Wu, Fan, Guo, Zhou, Ren, Liu and Luo.",0.40804597701149425

Antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are reported to be effective in the treatment of AO; however, their efficacy varies depending on the case. In this article, we report three types of AO and discuss its heterogeneity and management. Case presentation: In the first case, a 58-year-old woman presented with a heavy, splitting pain in the four maxillary front post-crown teeth, as if they were being pressed from the side. Her symptoms abated with 20 mg of amitriptyline. In the second case, a 39-year-old woman presented with a feeling of heaviness pain on the right side of maxillary and mandibular molar teeth, face, whole palate, and throat. She was unable to function because of her pain. Her symptoms drastically subsided with 3 mg of aripiprazole. In the third case, a 54-year-old woman presented with a tingling sensation on the left mandibular second premolar and first molar, and an uncomfortable feeling on her provisional prosthesis that made it unbearable to keep the caps on. Her symptoms diminished with 2 mg of aripiprazole added to 30 mg of mirtazapine. Conclusions: AO shows various features and responses to drugs. It is considered not only a purely sensory problem, but also a considerably complex psychological problem, such as rumination about the pain. Investigating the difference in pharmacotherapeutic responses might help to advance the treatment of AO. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.3253012048192771

While there has been some previous research on proof validation, the need for studies with school students is pressing. For this paper, we focus on proof validation and modification during secondary school geometry. For that purpose, we employ Lakatos’ notion of local counterexample that rejects a specific step in a proof. By using Toulmin's framework to analyze data from a task-based questionnaire completed by 32 ninth-grade students in a class in Japan, we identify what attempts the students made in producing local counterexamples to their proofs and modifying their proofs to deal with local counterexamples. We found that student difficulties related to producing diagrams that satisfied the condition of the set proof problem and to generating acceptable warrants for claims. The classroom use of tasks that entail student discovery of local counterexamples may help to improve students’ learning of proof and proving. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.48148148148148145

A measurement of emotion associated with wisdom would be especially informative; therefore, a novel Thin-Slice measurement of wisdom was developed based on the Berlin Paradigm. For about 2 min, participants imagined the lens of a camera as the eyes of their friend/teacher whom they advised about a life dilemma. Verbal response and facial expression were both recorded by a camera: verbal responses were then rated on both the Berlin Wisdom criteria and newly developed Chinese wisdom criteria; facial expressions were analyzed by the software iMotion FACET module. Results showed acceptable inter-rater and inter-item reliability for this novel paradigm. Moreover, both wisdom ratings were not significantly correlated with Social desirability, and the Berlin wisdom rating was significantly negatively correlated with Neuroticism; feeling of surprise was significantly positively correlated with both wisdom criteria ratings.

"Increase in the prescription rate of antidepressants after the Sewol Ferry disaster in Ansan, South Korea",2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019159659&doi=10.1016%2fj.jad.2017.05.026&partnerID=40&md5=545e951107c748394d2cf8d239fa06c3,"Background Previous pharmaco-epidemiological studies have reported increases in the prescription of psychotropic medications after a disaster, reflecting post-disaster changes in psychiatric conditions and mental health service utilization. We investigated changes in the prescription of psychotropic medications in the Danwon district of Ansan city (Ansan Danwon) compared to a control community before and after the Sewol Ferry disaster on April 16, 2014. Methods Data was collected from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. We analyzed the prescription rates of psychotropic medications including antidepressants, anxiolytics, and sedatives/hypnotics, and investigated whether the time-series pattern of monthly prescriptions per 100,000 people was different in Ansan Danwon compared to that in Cheonan city after the Sewol Ferry disaster through difference-in-differences regression analysis. Results Ansan Danwon showed a significantly greater increase (5.6%) in the prescription rate of antidepressants compared to Cheonan city following the Sewol Ferry disaster. There were no significant differences in changes in the prescription rates of anxiolytics or sedatives/hypnotics. In the secondary analysis, a significantly greater increase in the prescription rate of antipsychotics was observed in Ansan Danwon compared to a control community after the disaster. Limitations We could not exclude the possibility that other events influenced changes in the prescription rates of psychotropic medications during the study period. Conclusions Pharmaco-epidemiological studies on psychotropic medication prescription after a disaster provide important information about population-level mental health. Our results suggest that the Sewol Ferry disaster exerted a harmful effect on the mental health status of the affected community. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.39591836734693875
Do tiger keelback snakes (Rhabdophis tigrinus) recognize how toxic they are?,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021716404&doi=10.1037%2fcom0000075&partnerID=40&md5=2f076af75515dd3b38274432b39156a8,"Animals that depend on defensive chemicals acquired from food may face a decision when attempting to deter predatory attacks: Should they exhibit antipredator behavior that relies on the toxicity of the sequestered chemicals or should they adopt other behaviors that can avoid predation without using the chemical defense, such as flight Thus, it is reasonable to assume that animals that sequester prey toxins have evolved the ability to flexibly change their antipredator responses according to the amount of toxin-resource they have consumed. We tested this hypothesis using an Asian snake, Rhabdophis tigrinus, that sequesters toxins from toads consumed as food and stores them in specialized organs back of the head, called nuchal glands. We reared hatchling snakes from toad-free and toad-rich islands on controlled diets and examined their subsequent antipredator responses after 3 and 6 month feeding. Juveniles from a toad-free island that had been fed a diet including toads for 3 months showed antipredator displays associated with the nuchal glands more frequently than those that had been fed a diet without toads. They showed a similar, but less clear, tendency after 6 months feeding. Juveniles from the toad-rich island did not show a clear tendency of dietary effect. We discuss possible reasons for the different dietary effects between the 2 populations and between the ages. Our results, along with previous related phenomena in other animals, suggest that the ability of self-toxicity-recognition may be widespread in animals that sequester defensive toxins from facultative food. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.4462809917355372
Narrative constructions for the organization of self experience: Proof of concept via embodied robotics,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027707021&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01331&partnerID=40&md5=fa4007efe9d75350b12c5e98e12700b4,"It has been proposed that starting from meaning that the child derives directly from shared experience with others, adult narrative enriches this meaning and its structure, providing causal links between unseen intentional states and actions. This would require a means for representing meaning from experience-a situation model-and a mechanism that allows information to be extracted from sentences and mapped onto the situation model that has been derived from experience, thus enriching that representation. We present a hypothesis and theory concerning how the language processing infrastructure for grammatical constructions can naturally be extended to narrative constructions to provide a mechanism for using language to enrich meaning derived from physical experience. Toward this aim, the grammatical construction models are augmented with additional structures for representing relations between events across sentences. Simulation results demonstrate proof of concept for how the narrative construction model supports multiple successive levels of meaning creation which allows the system to learn about the intentionality of mental states, and argument substitution which allows extensions to metaphorical language and analogical problem solving. Cross-linguistic validity of the system is demonstrated in Japanese. The narrative construction model is then integrated into the cognitive system of a humanoid robot that provides the memory systems and world-interaction required for representing meaning in a situation model. In this context proof of concept is demonstrated for how the system enriches meaning in the situation model that has been directly derived from experience. In terms of links to empirical data, the model predicts strong usage based effects: that is, that the narrative constructions used by children will be highly correlated with those that they experience. It also relies on the notion of narrative or discourse function words. Both of these are validated in the experimental literature. © 2017 Mealier, Pointeau, Mirliaz, Ogawa, Finlayson and Dominey.",0.49324324324324326
Can we retrieve the information which was intentionally forgotten? electrophysiological correlates of strategic retrieval in directed forgetting,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028499893&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01480&partnerID=40&md5=d4504317d280fac1387c6bd297a786ab,"Retrieval inhibition hypothesis of directed forgetting effects assumed TBF (to-be-forgotten) items were not retrieved intentionally, while selective rehearsal hypothesis assumed the memory representation of retrieved TBF (to-be-forgotten) items was weaker than TBR (to-be-remembered) items. Previous studies indicated that directed forgetting effects of item-cueing method resulted from selective rehearsal at encoding, but the mechanism of retrieval inhibition that affected directed forgetting of TBF (to-be-forgotten) items was not clear. Strategic retrieval is a control process allowing the selective retrieval of target information, which includes retrieval orientation and strategic recollection. Retrieval orientation via the comparison of tasks refers to the specific form of processing resulted by retrieval efforts. Strategic recollection is the type of strategies to recollect studied items for the retrieval success of targets. Using a “directed forgetting” paradigm combined with a memory exclusion task, our investigation of strategic retrieval in directed forgetting assisted to explore how retrieval inhibition played a role on directed forgetting effects. When TBF items were targeted, retrieval orientation showed more positive ERPs to new items, indicating that TBF items demanded more retrieval efforts. The results of strategic recollection indicated that: (a) when TBR items were retrieval targets, late parietal old/new effects were only evoked by TBR items but not TBF items, indicating the retrieval inhibition of TBF items; (b) when TBF items were retrieval targets, the late parietal old/new effect were evoked by both TBR items and TBF items, indicating that strategic retrieval could overcome retrieval inhibition of TBF items. These findings suggested the modulation of strategic retrieval on retrieval inhibition of directed forgetting, supporting that directed forgetting effects were not only caused by selective rehearsal, but also retrieval inhibition. © 2017 Mao, Tian, Liu, Li, Jin, Wu and Guo.",0.4875444839857651
Measures of potential flexibility and practical flexibility in equation solving,2017,32,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027411869&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01368&partnerID=40&md5=ccf0578aedc720a69875f32f412c6877,"Researchers interested in mathematical proficiency have recently begun to explore the development of strategic flexibility, where flexibility is defined as knowledge of multiple strategies for solving a problem and the ability to implement an innovative strategy for a given problem solving circumstance. However, anecdotal findings from this literature indicate that students do not consistently use an innovative strategy for solving a given problem, even when these same students demonstrate knowledge of innovative strategies. This distinction, sometimes framed in the psychological literature as competence vs. performance-has not been previously studied for flexibility. In order to explore the competence/performance distinction in flexibility, this study developed and validated measures for potential flexibility (e.g., competence, or knowledge of multiple strategies) and practical flexibility (e.g., performance, use of innovative strategies) for solving equations. The measures were administrated to a sample of 158 Chinese middle school students through a Tri-Phase Flexibility Assessment, in which the students were asked to solve each equation, generate additional strategies, and evaluate own multiple strategies. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor model of potential and practical flexibility. Satisfactory internal consistency was found for the measures. Additional validity evidence included the significant association with flexibility measured with the previous method. Potential flexibility and practical flexibility were found to be distinct but related. The theoretical and practical implications of the concepts and their measures of potential flexibility and practical flexibility are discussed. © 2017 Xu, Liu, Star, Wang, Liu and Zhen.",0.4978723404255319
Dynamic correlations between intrinsic connectivity and extrinsic connectivity of the auditory cortex in humans,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027870321&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00407&partnerID=40&md5=a8f2a2d5c7babf1b34ebd8798d0cd563,"The arrival of sound signals in the auditory cortex (AC) triggers both local and inter-regional signal propagations over time up to hundreds of milliseconds and builds up both intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) and extrinsic functional connectivity (eFC) of the AC. However, interactions between iFC and eFC are largely unknown. Using intracranial stereo-electroencephalographic recordings in people with drug-refractory epilepsy, this study mainly investigated the temporal dynamic of the relationships between iFC and eFC of the AC. The results showed that a Gaussian wideband-noise burst markedly elicited potentials in both the AC and numerous higher-order cortical regions outside the AC (non-auditory cortices). Granger causality analyses revealed that in the earlier time window, iFC of the AC was positively correlated with both eFC from the AC to the inferior temporal gyrus and that to the inferior parietal lobule. While in later periods, the iFC of the AC was positively correlated with eFC from the precentral gyrus to the AC and that from the insula to the AC. In conclusion, dual-directional interactions occur between iFC and eFC of the AC at different time windows following the sound stimulation and may form the foundation underlying various central auditory processes, including auditory sensory memory, object formation, integrations between sensory, perceptional, attentional, motor, emotional, and executive processes. © 2017 Cui, Wang, Gao, Wang, Wang, Teng, Guan, Zhou, Li, Luan and Li.",0.34234234234234234

Gender and expression processing displayed a mutual interaction. On the one hand, the judgment of angry expressions occurred faster when presented with male facial images; on the other hand, the classification of the female gender occurred faster when presented with a happy facial expression than when presented with an angry facial expression. According to the evoked-related potential results, the expression classification was influenced by gender during the face structural processing stage (as indexed by N170), which indicates the promotion or interference of facial gender with the coding of facial expression features. However, gender processing was affected by facial expressions in more stages, including the early (P1) and late (LPC) stages of perceptual processing, reflecting that emotional expression influences gender processing mainly by directing attention. © 2017 Liu, Liu, Iqbal, Li, Lv and Jiang.",0.5408163265306123
Reduced gray matter volume in the social brain network in adults with autism spectrum disorder,2017,48,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027840535&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00395&partnerID=40&md5=e5d3f8da293af8e22d21305a815c9017,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral impairment in social interactions. Although theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that impairment in the social brain network could be the neural underpinnings of ASD, previous structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in adults with ASD have not provided clear support for this, possibly due to confounding factors, such as language impairments. To further explore this issue, we acquired structural MRI data and analyzed gray matter volume in adults with ASD (n = 36) who had no language impairments (diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, with symptoms milder than those of Asperger’s disorder), had no comorbidity, and were not taking medications, and in age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) controls (n = 36). Univariate voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed that regional gray matter volume was lower in the ASD than in the control group in several brain regions, including the right inferior occipital gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, bilateral amygdala, right inferior frontal gyrus, right orbitofrontal cortex, and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A multivariate approach using a partial least squares (PLS) method showed that these regions constituted a network that could be used to discriminate between the ASD and TD groups. A PLS discriminant analysis using information from these regions showed high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision (>80%) in discriminating between the groups. These results suggest that reduced gray matter volume in the social brain network represents the neural underpinnings of behavioral social malfunctioning in adults with ASD. © 2017 Sato, Kochiyama, Uono, Yoshimura, Kubota, Sawada, Sakihama and Toichi.",0.44787644787644787

The current study examined the effects of a negative EC procedure on attitudes toward chocolate, and whether it influenced chocolate evaluation and consumption. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental condition in which chocolate images were paired with negative stimuli, or the control condition in which chocolate images were randomly paired with positive stimuli (50%) and negative stimuli (50%). Explicit and implicit attitudes toward chocolate images were collected. During an ostensible taste test, chocolate evaluation and consumption were assessed. Results revealed that compared to participants in the control condition, participants in the experimental condition showed more negative explicit and implicit attitudes toward chocolate images and evaluated chocolate more negatively during the taste test. However, chocolate consumption did not differ between experimental and control conditions. These findings suggest that pairing chocolate with negative stimuli can influence attitudes toward chocolate, though behavioral effects are absent. Intervention applications of EC provide avenues for future research and practices. © 2017 Wang, Wang, Zhang, Wang, Cui, Zhu and Fang.",0.5056179775280899

However, limited longitudinal research has examined if and how future orientation (individual protective factor) and social support (contextual protective factor) are associated with the indicators of psychological adjustment (i.e., life satisfaction, school satisfaction, happiness, and loneliness) of left-behind children. In the current longitudinal study, we examined the differences in psychological adjustment between left-behind children and non-left behind children (comparison children) in rural areas, and explored the protective roles of future orientation and social support on the immediate (cross-sectional effects) and subsequent (lagged effects) status of psychological adjustment for both groups of children, respectively. The sample included 897 rural children (Mage = 14.09, SD = 1.40) who participated in two waves of surveys across six months. Among the participants, 227 were left-behind children with two parents migrating, 176 were with one parent migrating, and 485 were comparison children. Results showed that, (1) left-behind children reported lower levels of life satisfaction, school satisfaction, and happiness, as well as a higher level of loneliness in both waves; (2) After controlling for several demographics and characteristics of parental migration among left-behind children, future orientation significantly predicted life satisfaction, school satisfaction, and happiness in both cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models, as well as loneliness in the longitudinal regression analysis. Social support predicted immediate life satisfaction, school satisfaction, and happiness, as well as subsequent school satisfaction. Similar to left-behind children, comparison children who reported higher scores in future orientation, especially future expectation, were likely to have higher scores in most indicators of psychological adjustment measured at the same time and subsequently. However, social support seemed not exhibit as important in the immediate status of psychological adjustment of comparison children as that of left-behind children.

We conducted a target identification task in which visual stimuli appeared briefly to the left and right of a fixation cross. In Experiment 1, the direction of the participant’s head (aligned with the body) was manipulated to the left, front, or right relative to a central fixation point. In Experiment 2, head direction was manipulated to the left, front, or right relative to the body direction. This manipulation was based on results showing that bias of eye position distribution was highly correlated with head direction. In both experiments, accuracy was greater when the target appeared at a position where the eyes would potentially be directed. Consequently, eye–head coordination influences visual attention. That is, attention can be automatically biased toward the location where the eyes tend to be directed. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.3821656050955414

One possible cause is the concern for a good reputation as a generous person, while the other is the concerns for a bad reputation as a norm violator. To elucidate which of these two concerns is the main influencer, the present study conducted a laboratory experiment that investigated whether the watching eyes effect changed depending on social norms. If the concern for a good reputation leads to the effect, prosocial behavior would be more likely in the presence of watching eyes, regardless of the social norms involved. However, if the concern for avoiding a bad reputation as a norm violator leads to the effect, watching eyes promote prosocial behavior only in the existence of prosocial norms. In the original study, participants were asked to make a charitable donation under conditions in which eye-like images either were or were not present. In addition to the eye-like images, we manipulated prosocial norms by informing each participant of either high or low mean donation amounts given by previous participants. We found that watching eyes promoted donations only when a prosocial norm existed. This supports the idea that the watching eyes effect is caused by a concern for avoiding a bad reputation from violating norms. However, in a replication study, we were unable to replicate the original results; watching eyes did not promote generosity regardless of the norm. Taken together, we discussed the moderation effect of norms and the possibility of other moderators. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.3793103448275862

Aim To describe movements and postures in 3- to 5-month-old infants with Down syndrome and assess the relation between pre- and perinatal risk factors and the eventual motor performance. Methods and procedures Exploratory study; 47 infants with Down syndrome (26 males, 27 infants born preterm, 22 infants with congenital heart disease) were videoed at 10–19 weeks post-term (median = 14 weeks). We assessed their Motor Optimality Score (MOS) based on postures and movements (including fidgety movements) and compared it to that of 47 infants later diagnosed with cerebral palsy and 47 infants with a normal neurological outcome, matched for gestational and recording ages. Outcomes and results The MOS (median = 13, range 10–28) was significantly lower than in infants with a normal neurological outcome (median = 26), but higher than in infants later diagnosed with cerebral palsy (median = 6). Fourteen infants with Down syndrome showed normal fidgety movements, 13 no fidgety movements, and 20 exaggerated, too fast or too slow fidgety movements. A lack of movements to the midline and several atypical postures were observed. Neither preterm birth nor congenital heart disease was related to aberrant fidgety movements or reduced MOS. Conclusions and implications The heterogeneity in fidgety movements and MOS add to an understanding of the large variability of the early phenotype of Down syndrome. Studies on the predictive values of the early spontaneous motor repertoire, especially for the cognitive outcome, are warranted. What this paper adds The significance of this exploratory study lies in its minute description of the motor repertoire of infants with Down syndrome aged 3–5 months. Thirty percent of infants with Down syndrome showed age-specific normal fidgety movements. The rate of abnormal fidgety movements (large amplitude, high/slow speed) or a lack of fidgety movements was exceedingly high. The motor optimality score of infants with Down syndrome was lower than in infants with normal neurological outcome but higher than in infants who were later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Neither preterm birth nor congenital heart disease were related to the motor performance at 3–5 months. © 2017 The Authors",0.40588235294117647

The present research focuses on whether individuals who hold the implicit belief that people's moral character is fixed (entity theorists) and individuals who hold the implicit belief that people's moral character is malleable (incremental theorists) make different choices when facing a moral decision. Incremental theorists are less likely to make the fundamental attribution error (FAE), rarely make moral judgment based on traits and show more tolerance to immorality, relative to entity theorists, which might decrease the possibility of undermining the self-image when they engage in immoral behaviors, and thus we posit that incremental beliefs facilitate immorality. Four studies were conducted to explore the effect of these two types of implicit theories on immoral intention or practice. The association between implicit theories and immoral behavior was preliminarily examined from the observer perspective in Study 1, and the results showed that people tended to associate immoral behaviors (including everyday immoral intention and environmental destruction) with an incremental theorist rather than an entity theorist. Then, the relationship was further replicated from the actor perspective in Studies 2–4. In Study 2, implicit theories, which were measured, positively predicted the degree of discrimination against carriers of the hepatitis B virus. In Study 3, implicit theories were primed through reading articles, and the participants in the incremental condition showed more cheating than those in the entity condition. In Study 4, implicit theories were primed through a new manipulation, and the participants in the unstable condition (primed incremental theory) showed more discrimination than those in the other three conditions. Taken together, the results of our four studies were consistent with our hypotheses. © 2017 Huang, Zuo, Wang, Cai and Wang.",0.44285714285714284

However, the underlying mechanism remains ambiguous. This study investigates this issue with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-twomale chronic smokers received real and sham stimulation over dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) separated by 1week. The neuroimaging data of the resting state, the smoking cue-reactivity task and the emotion task after stimulation were collected. The craving across the cue-reactivity task was diminished during real stimulation as compared with sham stimulation. The whole-brain analysis on the cue-reactivity task revealed a significant interaction between the stimulation condition (real vs sham) and the cue type (smoking vs neutral) in the left superior frontal gyrus and the leftmiddle frontal gyrus. The functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and the right parahippocampal gyrus, as revealed by both psychophysical interaction analysis and the resting state functional connectivity, is altered by electrical stimulation. Moreover, the craving change across the real and sham condition is predicted by alteration of functional connectivity revealed by psychophysical interaction analysis. The local and long-distance coupling, altered by the electrical stimulation,might be the underlying neural mechanism of craving regulation. © The Author (2017).",0.48947368421052634

Contextual Cueing Effect in Spatial Layout Defined by Binocular Disparity,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085335241&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01472&partnerID=40&md5=626da2db572b942331d6f24b3a0fa219,"Repeated visual context induces higher search efficiency, revealing a contextual cueing effect, which depends on the association between the target and its visual context. In this study, participants performed a visual search task where search items were presented with depth information defined by binocular disparity. When the 3-dimensional (3D) configurations were repeated over blocks, the contextual cueing effect was obtained (Experiment 1). When depth information was in chaos over repeated configurations, visual search was not facilitated and the contextual cueing effect largely crippled (Experiment 2). However, when we made the search items within a tiny random displacement in the 2-dimentional (2D) plane but maintained the depth information constant, the contextual cueing was preserved (Experiment 3). We concluded that the contextual cueing effect was robust in the context provided by 3D space with stereoscopic information, and more importantly, the visual system prioritized stereoscopic information in learning of spatial information when depth information was available. © Copyright © 2017 Zhao, Zhuang, Ma, Tu, Liu and Sun.",0.4873417721518987
Altered white matter integrity in smokers is associated with smoking cessation outcomes,2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031999621&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00438&partnerID=40&md5=847995ac29c4db8189d3905dae2bc18d,"Smoking is a significant cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Understanding the neural mechanisms of nicotine addiction and smoking cessation may provide effective targets for developing treatment strategies. In the present study, we explored whether smokers have white matter alterations and whether these alterations are related to cessation outcomes and smoking behaviors. Sixty-six smokers and thirty-seven healthy non-smokers were enrolled. The participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans and smoking-related behavioral assessments. After a 12-week treatment with varenicline, 28 smokers succeeded in quitting smoking and 38 failed. Diffusion parameter maps were compared among the non-smokers, future quitters, and relapsers to identify white matter differences. We found that the future relapsers had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the orbitofrontal area than non-smokers, and higher FA in the cerebellum than non-smokers and future quitters. The future quitters had significantly lower FA in the postcentral gyrus compared to non-smokers and future relapsers. Compared to non-smokers, pooled smokers had lower FA in bilateral orbitofrontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. In addition, regression analysis showed that the left orbitofrontal FA was correlated with smoking-relevant behaviors. These results suggest that white matter alterations in smokers may contribute to the formation of aberrant brain circuits underlying smoking behaviors and are associated with future smoking cessation outcomes. © 2017 Huang, Shen, Wang, Qian, Zhang, Yang and Zhang.",0.4325581395348837
Visual form perception can be a cognitive correlate of lower level math categories for teenagers,2017,36,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026848685&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01336&partnerID=40&md5=cca1ccffd6575a8b3ea68a8a01c71f52,"Numerous studies have assessed the cognitive correlates of performance in mathematics, but little research has been conducted to systematically examine the relations between visual perception as the starting point of visuospatial processing and typical mathematical performance. In the current study, we recruited 223 seventh graders to perform a visual form perception task (figure matching), numerosity comparison, digit comparison, exact computation, approximate computation, and curriculum-based mathematical achievement tests. Results showed that, after controlling for gender, age, and five general cognitive processes (choice reaction time, visual tracing, mental rotation, spatial working memory, and non-verbal matrices reasoning), visual form perception had unique contributions to numerosity comparison, digit comparison, and exact computation, but had no significant relation with approximate computation or curriculum-based mathematical achievement.

“Paradox of slow frequencies” – Are slow frequencies in upper cortical layers a neural predisposition of the level/state of consciousness (NPC)?,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017160033&doi=10.1016%2fj.concog.2017.03.006&partnerID=40&md5=7a58c548c989e843b99f416b8c61900b,"Consciousness research has much focused on faster frequencies like alpha or gamma while neglecting the slower ones in the infraslow (0.001–0.1 Hz) and slow (0.1–1 Hz) frequency range. These slower frequency ranges have a “bad reputation” though; their increase in power can observed during the loss of consciousness as in sleep, anesthesia, and vegetative state. However, at the same time, slower frequencies have been conceived instrumental for consciousness. The present paper aims to resolve this paradox which I describe as “paradox of slow frequencies”. I first show various data that suggest a central role of slower frequencies in integrating faster ones, i.e., “temporo-spatial integration and nestedness”. Such “temporo-spatial integration and nestedness” is disrupted during the loss of consciousness as in anesthesia and sleep leading to “temporo-spatial fragmentation and isolation” between slow and fast frequencies. Slow frequencies are supposedly mediated by neural activity in upper cortical layers in higher-order associative regions as distinguished from lower cortical layers that are related to faster frequencies. Taken together, slower and faster frequencies take on different roles for the level/state of consciousness. Faster frequencies by themselves are sufficient and thus a neural correlate of consciousness (NCC) while slower frequencies are a necessary non-sufficient condition of possible consciousness, e.g., a neural predisposition of the level/state of consciousness (NPC). This resolves the “paradox of slow frequencies” in that it assigns different roles to slower and faster frequencies in consciousness, i.e., NCC and NPC. Taken as NCC and NPC, fast and slow frequencies including their relation as in “temporo-spatial integration and nestedness” can be considered a first “building bloc” of a future “temporo-spatial theory of consciousness” (TTC) (Northoff, 2013; Northoff, 2014b; Northoff & Huang, 2017). © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.36496350364963503
Inhibitory control in speech comprehension among Dai-Han bilingual children,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027708850&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01391&partnerID=40&md5=ba72ce5be649b18d46ec1b8a8147e93f,"We aimed to investigate differences in inhibitory control ability between proficient and non-proficient Dai-Han bilinguals. Two experiments used a combined stimulus-stimulus and stimulus-response compatibility paradigm for this purpose. Participants were Dai-Han bilingual primary-school students selected from a Dai-speaking town in Yunnan province, China. In Dai language interference condition, participants were asked to complete a picture category task. Results showed that the effect of attentional control for non-proficient bilinguals (NPBs) was significantly greater than that for proficient bilinguals (PBs), while the effect of response inhibition was not. This implied that a difference in inhibitory control between PBs and NPBs appeared at the attention control stage when interference by the Dai lexicon emerged. In Han language interference condition, however, participants were also asked to complete the same task. Results showed that the effect of response inhibition for NPBs was significantly greater than that for PBs, but the effect of attentional control was not. This demonstrated that a difference in inhibitory control emerged at the response inhibition stage when interference by the Han lexicon emerged. This pattern of results is opposite to previous researches, which indicated that the difference between PBs and NPBs occurred at the response inhibition stage under first language condition, whereas at the attentional control stage under second language (L2) condition. Based on these, this study suggests that Dai-Han bilinguals showed a remarkable L2 advantage. In addition, results showed that response times (RTs) of PBs were faster than RTs of NPBs while confounding variables (e.g., intelligence, etc.) were under control. This indicates that the inhibitory control ability of the PBs is superior to that of NPBs in this study. © 2017 Tao, Liu, Tempel, Chen, Ma, Wang, Liu and Qu.",0.4568345323741007
The influence of performance on action-effect integration in sense of agency,2017,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021189564&doi=10.1016%2fj.concog.2017.06.008&partnerID=40&md5=ab129f1c784c59125bd4ae652549d87b,"Sense of agency refers to the subjective feeling of being able to control an outcome through one's own actions or will. Prior studies have shown that both sensory processing (e.g., comparisons between sensory feedbacks and predictions basing on one's motor intentions) and high-level cognitive/constructive processes (e.g., inferences based on one's performance or the consequences of one's actions) contribute to judgments of sense of agency. However, it remains unclear how these two types of processes interact, which is important for clarifying the mechanisms underlying sense of agency. Thus, we examined whether performance-based inferences influence action-effect integration in sense of agency using a delay detection paradigm in two experiments. In both experiments, participants pressed left and right arrow keys to control the direction in which a moving dot was travelling. The dot's response delay was manipulated randomly on 7 levels (0–480 ms) between the trials; for each trial, participants were asked to judge whether the dot response was delayed and to rate their level of agency over the dot. In Experiment 1, participants tried to direct the dot to reach a destination on the screen as quickly as possible. Furthermore, the computer assisted participants by ignoring erroneous commands for half of the trials (assisted condition), while in the other half, all of the participants’ commands were executed (self-control condition). In Experiment 2, participants directed the dot as they pleased (without a specific goal), but, in half of the trials, the computer randomly ignored 32% of their commands (disturbed condition) rather than assisted them. The results from the two experiments showed that performance enhanced action-effect integration. Specifically, when task performance was improved through the computer's assistance in Experiment 1, delay detection was reduced in the 480-ms delay condition, despite the fact that 32% of participants’ commands were ignored. Conversely, when no feedback on task performance was given (as in Experiment 2), the participants reported greater delay when some of their commands were randomly ignored. Furthermore, the results of a logistic regression analysis showed that the threshold of delay detection was greater in the assisted condition than in the self-control condition in Experiment 1, which suggests a wider time window for action-effect integration. A multivariate analysis also revealed that assistance was related to reduced delay detection via task performance, while reduced delay detection was directly correlated with a better sense of agency. These results indicate an association between the implicit and explicit aspects of sense of agency. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.4823232323232323
The effects of trait and state affect on diurnal cortisol slope among children affected by parental HIV/AIDS in rural China,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007425292&doi=10.1080%2f09540121.2016.1274015&partnerID=40&md5=4682c52a7c96fe01cfcd3a6c04a76683,"Affect is believed to be one of the most prominent proximal psychological pathway through which more distal psychosocial factors influence physiology and ultimately health. The current study examines the relative contributions of trait affect and state affect to the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity, with particular focus on cortisol slope, in children affected by parental HIV/AIDS. A sample of 645 children (8–15 years old) affected by parental HIV/AIDS in rural China completed a multiple-day naturalistic salivary cortisol protocol. Trait and state affect, demographics, and psychosocial covariates were assessed via self-report. Hierarchical linear modeling was used for estimating the effects of trait affect and state affect on cortisol slope. Confidence intervals for indirect effects were estimated using the Monte Carlo method. Our results indicated that both trait and state negative affect (NA) predicted flatter (less “healthy”) diurnal cortisol slopes. Subsequent analyses revealed that children’s state NA mediated the effect of their trait NA on diurnal cortisol slope. The same relationships did not emerge for trait and state positive affect. These findings provide a rationale for future interventions that target NA as a modifiable antecedent of compromised health-related endocrine processes among children affected by parental HIV/AIDS. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.5

We recruited 52 elderly people who were aged ≥60 years and were active drivers. These participants undertook the driving simulation test, and we measured their PSR, SPR, and device operation responses. PSR tended to be greater in hazard scenes that involved anticipation or complexity processes, suggesting the involvement of factors such as the participants’ readiness to anticipate hazards and their emotional changes. SPR response was faster in hazard scenes that involved a surprise process. SPR response was faster than braking response, except in scenes where the participants had only a fleeting moment to react to the hazard, suggesting that SPR is a suitable evaluation index for hazard perception timing. Two participants were suspected of having decreased cognitive function according to the Mini-Mental State Examination. These individuals exhibited PSR and SPR responses that were not consistent with the hazard scenes, and they made errors in their operation of the driving simulator. These findings highlight the need to examine the impact of decreased cognitive function on hazard perception. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.45454545454545453
Stuttering thoughts: Negative self-referent thinking is less sensitive to aversive outcomes in people with higher levels of depressive symptoms,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026842508&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01333&partnerID=40&md5=c31eb0f3112c16985c9017d70590cdbc,"Learning theories of depression have proposed that depressive cognitions, such as negative thoughts with reference to oneself, can develop through a reinforcement learning mechanism. This negative self-reference is considered to be positively reinforced by rewarding experiences such as genuine support from others after negative self-disclosure, and negatively reinforced by avoidance of potential aversive situations. The learning account additionally predicts that negative self-reference would be maintained by an inability to adjust one's behavior when negative self-reference no longer leads to such reward. To test this prediction, we designed an adapted version of the reversal-learning task. In this task, participants were reinforced to choose and engage in either negative or positive self-reference by probabilistic economic reward and punishment. Although participants were initially trained to choose negative self-reference, the stimulus-reward contingencies were reversed to prompt a shift toward positive self-reference (Study 1) and a further shift toward negative self-reference (Study 2). Model-based computational analyses showed that depressive symptoms were associated with a low learning rate of negative self-reference, indicating a high level of reward expectancy for negative self-reference even after the contingency reversal. Furthermore, the difficulty in updating outcome predictions of negative self-reference was significantly associated with the extent to which one possesses negative self-images. These results suggest that difficulty in adjusting action-outcome estimates for negative self-reference increases the chance to be faced with negative aspects of self, which may result in depressive symptoms. © 2017 Iijima, Takano, Boddez, Raes and Tanno.",0.4340425531914894

According to Signed Residual Time (SRT) scores based on response speed and accuracy trade-off, 20 subjects were divided into two groups, namely high-performance and low performance groups, to undertake working memory (WM) tasks. We found that spectral entropy derived from the retention period of WM on channel FC4 exhibited a high correlation with SRT scores. To this end, spectral entropy was used in support vector machine classifier with linear kernel to differentiate these two groups. Receiver operating characteristics analysis and leave-one out cross-validation (LOOCV) demonstrated that the averaged classification accuracy (CA) was 90.0 and 92.5% for intra-session and inter-session, respectively, indicating that spectral entropy could be used to distinguish these two different WM performance groups successfully. Furthermore, the support vector regression prediction model with radial basis function kernel and the root-mean square error of prediction revealed that spectral entropy could be utilized to predict SRT scores on individual WM performance. After testing the changes in SRT scores and spectral entropy for each subject by short-time training, we found that 16 in 20 subjects’ SRT scores were clearly promoted after training and 15 in 20 subjects’ SRT scores showed consistent changes with spectral entropy before and after training. The findings revealed that spectral entropy could be a promising indicator to predict individual’s WM changes by training and further provide a novel application about WM for brain–computer interfaces. © 2017 Tian, Zhang, Xu, Zhang, Yang, Zheng and Shi.",0.38235294117647056

Bullying was assessed by self- and peer-report. The discrepancy in perception of bullying experiences was defined by the concordance or discordance between self- and peer-reports. Internalizing and externalizing behavior was evaluated using the Youth Self Report and Child Behavior Checklist, at baseline and follow-up. Two by two ANCOVA was performed with a factorial design, categorizing discrepancy in perception of bullying experiences based on the agreement between self-report and peer-report. Internalizing/externalizing behavior-at-follow-up was used as an outcome, adjusting for other known risk factors for internalizing/externalizing behavior, including baseline internalizing/externalizing behavior, and bullying experiences. Adolescents with perceptions of bullying experiences discrepant from peer-reports showed increased internalizing/externalizing behavior at follow-up. Bullying also stands out as an independent risk factor for the development of future externalizing behavior even among adolescents with accurate perceptions of bullying experiences.

In contrast, disorderly environments are aesthetically aversive, and have various detrimental psychological effects. But in our research, we have repeatedly found that natural environments are perceptually disorderly. What could explain this paradox? We present 3 competing hypotheses: the aesthetic preference for naturalness is more powerful than the aesthetic aversion to disorder (the nature-trumps-disorder hypothesis); disorder is trivial to aesthetic preference in natural contexts (the harmless-disorder hypothesis); and disorder is aesthetically preferred in natural contexts (the beneficialdisorder hypothesis). Utilizing novel methods of perceptual study and diverse stimuli, we rule in the nature-trumps-disorder hypothesis and rule out the harmless-disorder and beneficial-disorder hypotheses. In examining perceptual mechanisms, we find evidence that high-level scene semantics are both necessary and sufficient for the nature-trumps-disorder effect. Necessity is evidenced by the effect disappearing in experiments utilizing only low-level visual stimuli (i.e., where scene semantics have been removed) and experiments utilizing a rapid-scene-presentation procedure that obscures scene semantics. Sufficiency is evidenced by the effect reappearing in experiments utilizing noun stimuli which remove low-level visual features. Furthermore, we present evidence that the interaction of scene semantics with low-level visual features amplifies the nature-trumps-disorder effect-the effect is weaker both when statistically adjusting for quantified low-level visual features and when using noun stimuli which remove low-level visual features. These results have implications for psychological theories bearing on the joint influence of low- and high-level perceptual inputs on affect and cognition, as well as for aesthetic design. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.5179282868525896

Two waves of consecutive cohort samples, totaling 115 participants diagnosed with lung cancer, were identified from outpatient oncology clinics. Of these, 93 consented and completed the first of three assessments, and 57 completed the study. Prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSD Checklist) and posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory) were assessed and used to predict physical and mental health components of quality of life (Short-Form 36) and survival. Patients reported both negative and positive psychological sequelae, with prevalence of estimated PTSD ranging from 5% to 16% at each assessment as determined by symptom and cut-off methods. Posttraumatic stress and growth were positively related, but were differentially associated with outcomes. More posttraumatic stress predicted lower mental health quality of life, whereas more posttraumatic growth predicted better physical health quality of life and longer survival. These relationships persisted after accounting for disease variables and attrition due to death or illness. These findings highlight the importance of using longitudinal designs to identify relationships between stress and resilience factors in predicting outcomes. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.5422885572139303

Neuroscientific studies suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) play significant roles in human decision making under uncertainty. We applied the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) device to modulate the activity of participants' DLPFC and OFC separately, comparing the causal relationships between people's behaviors and the activity of the corresponding brain cortex when confronted with situations of risk and ambiguity. Our experiment employed a pre–post design and a risk/ambiguity decision-making task, from which we could calculate the preferences via an estimation model. We found evidences that modulating the activity of the DLPFC using right anodal/left cathodal tDCS significantly enhanced the participants' preferences for risk, whereas modulating the activity of the OFC with right anodal/left cathodal tDCS significantly decreased the participants' preferences for ambiguity. The reverse effects were also observed in the reversed tDCS treatments on the two areas. Our results suggest that decision-making processes under risk and ambiguity are complicated and may be encoded in two distinct circuits in our brains as the DLPFC primarily impacts decisions under risk whereas the OFC affects ambiguity. © 2017 Yang, Gao, Shi, Ye and Chen.",0.525

A total of 157 healthy Korean adult volunteers were included and divided into two groups using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) score. The subjective inattention scores, ADHD scale, and anxiety and depression symptom were evaluated. EEG was recorded and quantitative band powers were analyzed. The results were as follows: (1) the high CTQ group showed significantly increased delta, beta1, beta2, beta3 and gamma, and significantly decreased low alpha power compared to the low CTQ group; (2) the high CTQ group had higher inattention score compared to the low CTQ group; (3) the high CTQ group had higher adult ADHD scores; (4) CTQ scores showed significant positive correlations with inattention scores, and adult ADHD scores; (5) unexpectedly, the inattention scores showed significant positive correlations with beta powers and a negative correlation with low alpha power; and (6) the moderated mediation model was confirmed: the depression fully mediated the path from state anxiety to inattention, and the CTQ significantly moderated the pathway between anxiety and depression. Our results show the possibility that childhood adversity may cause subjective inattention and adult ADHD symptoms. Depressive symptoms fully mediated the path from anxiety to inattention, especially in those who report severe childhood traumatic experiences. © 2017 Lee, Park, Jin, Lee and Hahn.",0.3815261044176707
Brain potentials predict language selection before speech onset in bilinguals,2017,29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018528295&doi=10.1016%2fj.bandl.2017.04.002&partnerID=40&md5=4a7496e13627c2869dfe7d7c4e1911a3,"Studies of language production in bilinguals have seldom considered the fact that language selection likely involves proactive control. Here, we show that Chinese-English bilinguals actively inhibit the language not-to-be used before the onset of a picture to be named. Depending on the nature of a directive cue, participants named a subsequent picture in their native language, in their second language, or remained silent. The cue elicited a contingent negative variation of event-related brain potentials, greater in amplitude when the cue announced a naming trial as compared to when it announced a silent trial. In addition, the negativity was greater in amplitude when the picture was to be named in English than in Chinese, suggesting that preparation for speech in the second language requires more inhibition than preparation for speech in the native language. This result is the first direct neurophysiological evidence consistent with proactive inhibitory control in bilingual production. © 2017",0.4966442953020134

We explore how the complexity of a worker's longest served job affects cognitive functioning after retirement. In particular, we investigate eight dimensions of the longest served job using information listed in the United States Dictionary of Occupational Titles, namely physical demands, mathematical development, reasoning development, language development, the job's relationship to data, the job's relationship to people, the job's relationship to things and the specific vocational preparation required. Our estimator takes account of the potential endogeneity of the duration of retirement and the left-censoring of the duration of retirement. Our empirical evidence suggests that the duration of retirement has a negative and significant impact on cognitive functioning. Moreover, among the eight dimensions of job characteristics, high complexity in the job's relation to data is found to be an important job characteristic in delaying the deterioration of cognitive functioning after retirement. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",0.5
Prejudice and health anxiety about radiation exposure from second-generation atomic bomb survivors: results from a qualitative interview study,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028464133&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01462&partnerID=40&md5=8db2afd1e9bc110b91048ce4de6519a0,"The effect of atomic bomb radiation exposure on the survivors and their children has been a worrisome problem since soon after the 1945 Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Researchers have examined physical and genetic effects; however, no research has focused on second-generation survivors' (SGS) psychological effects. Consequently, this study shed light on the SGS' experience of discrimination and prejudice and their anxiety concerning the genetic effects of radiation exposure. This study utilized semi-structured interviews with 14 SGS (10 women, mean age = 56 ± 6.25 years, range = 46–68 years). Data were analyzed using a modified version of the grounded theory approach. Three categories were extracted: low awareness as an SGS, no health anxiety regarding the effect of radiation, and health anxiety regarding the effect of radiation. The results did not reveal that SGS who grew up in the bombed areas experienced discrimination or prejudice. They had little health anxiety from childhood to adolescence. In this study, some of the SGS developed health anxiety about their third-generation children, but only among female participants. Perhaps the transgenerational transmission of anxiety concerning the genetic effects of radiation exposure causes stress, particularly among women with children. However, a change was seen in adulthood health anxiety regarding the effects of radiation, suggesting the possibility that changes in the psychological experiences of SGS can be observed throughout their lifetimes and that their own health status, and that of their children, the third-generation survivors, affects their health anxiety regarding radiation. © 2017 Kamite.",0.41702127659574467
Effects of lip color on perceived lightness of human facial skin,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026750324&doi=10.1177%2f2041669517717500&partnerID=40&md5=5bb7406b1105ce2b9e48bd9bcf14196a,"Whereas geometric illusions in human faces have been reported by several studies, illusions of color or lightness in faces have seldom been explored. Here, we psychophysically investigated whether lip color influences facial skin’s perceived lightness. Results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that redder lips lightened and darker lips darkened the perceived complexion. These lightness or darkness inducing effects differ from the classical illusion of lightness contrast in nonface objects for two reasons. First, illusory effects are more assimilative than contrastive. Second, the inducing area (i.e., lips) is much smaller than the influenced area (facial skin). Experiment 2 showed that the assimilative lightness induction was caused by holistic processing of faces. This is the first study to scientifically substantiate the claim of cosmetics manufacturers and makeup artists that lip colors can alter perceived facial skin color. Implications for face perception, lightness illusion, and perceptual effects of cosmetics are discussed. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.5170068027210885
Electrophysiological signals associated with fluency of different levels of processing reveal multiple contributions to recognition memory,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019661536&doi=10.1016%2fj.concog.2017.05.001&partnerID=40&md5=7bfce2c185dbab388422c0fc6a2861b0,"Processing fluency appears to influence recognition memory judgements, and the manipulation of fluency, if misattributed to an effect of prior exposure, can result in illusory memory. Although it is well established that fluency induced by masked repetition priming leads to increased familiarity, manipulations of conceptual fluency have produced conflicting results, variously affecting familiarity or recollection. Some recent studies have found that masked conceptual priming increases correct recollection (Taylor & Henson, 2012), and the magnitude of this behavioural effect correlates with analogous fMRI BOLD priming effects in brain regions associated with recollection (Taylor, Buratto, & Henson, 2013). However, the neural correlates and time-courses of masked repetition and conceptual priming were not compared directly in previous studies. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to identify and compare the electrophysiological correlates of masked repetition and conceptual priming and investigate how they contribute to recognition memory. Behavioural results were consistent with previous studies: Repetition primes increased familiarity, whereas conceptual primes increased correct recollection. Masked repetition and conceptual priming also decreased the latency of late parietal component (LPC). Masked repetition priming was associated with an early P200 effect and a later parietal maximum N400 effect, whereas masked conceptual priming was only associated with a central-parietal maximum N400 effect. In addition, the topographic distributions of the N400 repetition priming and conceptual priming effects were different. These results suggest that fluency at different levels of processing is associated with different ERP components, and contributes differentially to subjective recognition memory experiences. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.5247933884297521
Factor structure and longitudinal measurement invariance of PHQ-9 for specialist mental health care patients with persistent major depressive disorder: Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling,2017,46,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019158646&doi=10.1016%2fj.jad.2017.05.020&partnerID=40&md5=d6700a8764d3ba1330599af4650b85b2,"Background The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely used instrument for measuring levels of depression in patients in clinical practice and academic research; its factor structure has been investigated in various samples, with limited evidence of measurement equivalence/invariance (ME/I) but not in patients with more severe depression of long duration. This study aims to explore the factor structure of the PHQ-9 and the ME/I between treatment groups over time for these patients. Methods 187 secondary care patients with persistent major depressive disorder (PMDD) were recruited to a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with allocation to either a specialist depression team arm or a general mental health arm; their PHQ-9 score was measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Exploratory Structural Equational Modelling (ESEM) was performed to examine the factor structure for this specific patient group. ME/I between treatment arm at and across follow-up time were further explored by means of multiple-group ESEM approach using the best-fitted factor structure. Results A two-factor structure was evidenced (somatic and affective factor). This two-factor structure had strong factorial invariance between the treatment groups at and across follow up times. Limitations Participants were largely white British in a RCT with 40% attrition potentially limiting the study's generalisability. Not all two-factor modelling criteria were met at every time-point. Conclusion PHQ-9 has a two-factor structure for PMDD patients, with strong measurement invariance between treatment groups at and across follow-up time, demonstrating its validity for RCTs and prospective longitudinal studies in chronic moderate to severe depression. © 2017",0.4918032786885246
Microstructural changes of the human brain from early to mid-adulthood,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027843180&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00393&partnerID=40&md5=cc2f48ad07d73233a6c61760a36de7b0,"Despite numerous studies on the microstructural changes of the human brain throughout life, we have indeed little direct knowledge about the changes from early to mid-adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate the microstructural changes of the human brain from early to mid-adulthood. We performed two sets of analyses based on the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of 111 adults aged 18–55 years. Specifically, we first correlated age with skeletonized fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) at global and regional level, and then estimated individuals’ ages based on each DTI metric using elastic net, a kind of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) method that aims at selecting the model that achieves the best trade-off between goodness of fit and model complexity. We observed statistically significant negative age-vs-FA correlations and relatively less changes of MD. The negative age-vs-FA correlations were associated with negative age-vs-AD and positive age-vs-RD correlations. Regional negative age-vs-FA correlations were observed in the bilateral genu of the corpus callosum (CCg), the corticospinal tract (CST), the fornix and several other tracts, and these negative correlations may indicate the earlier changes of the fibers with aging. In brain age estimation, the chronological-vs-estimated-age correlations based on FA, MD, AD and RD were R = 0.62, 0.44, 0.63 and 0.69 (P = 0.002, 0.008, 0.002 and 0.002 based on 500 permutations), respectively, and these results indicate that even the microstructural changes from early to mid-adulthood alone are sufficiently specific to decode individuals’ ages. Overall, the current results not only demonstrated statistically significant FA decreases from early to mid-adulthood and clarified the driving factors of the FA decreases (RD increases and AD decreases, in contrast to increases of both measures in late-adulthood), but highlighted the necessity of considering age effects in related studies. © 2017 Tian and Ma.",0.4201388888888889
The BDNF val66met polymorphism affects the vulnerability of the brain structural network,2017,30,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027857737&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00400&partnerID=40&md5=b5f963ef91fce1e7841053c383504ab7,"Val66Met, a naturally occurring polymorphism in the human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene resulting in a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitution at codon 66, plays an important role in neuroplasticity. While the effect of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on local brain structures has previously been examined, its impact on the configuration of the graph-based white matter structural networks is yet to be investigated. In the current study, we assessed the effect of the BDNF polymorphism on the network properties and robustness of the graph-based white matter structural networks. Graph theory was employed to investigate the structural connectivity derived from white matter tractography in two groups, Val homozygotes (n = 18) and Met-allele carriers (n = 55). Although there were no differences in the global network measures including global efficiency, local efficiency, and modularity between the two genotype groups, we found the effect of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on the robustness properties of the white matter structural networks. Specifically, the white matter structural networks of the Met-allele carrier group showed higher vulnerability to targeted removal of central nodes as compared with those of the Val homozygote group. These findings suggest that the central role of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in regards to neuroplasticity may be associated with inherent differences in the robustness of the white matter structural network according to the genetic variants. Furthermore, greater susceptibility to brain disorders in Met-allele carriers may be understood as being due to their limited stability in white matter structural connectivity. © 2017 Park, Kim, Namgung, Lee, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Lyoo and Yoon.",0.3700787401574803

From an operational standpoint, it's an effective way to build and maintain social bonds between users and the community by boosting social communications, supporting fluent interpersonal communications. In addition, managers of an online community should elaborate on users' group intentions to increase users' advertising acceptance and response. © 2017 Zeng, Tao, Yang and Xie.",0.5151515151515151

Moreover, the indirect effect was stronger via self-esteem than via SSS. These findings perhaps provide insight into the preliminary effect that SSS and self-esteem underlie psychological suzhi’s effect on adolescents’ problem behaviors, and also are important in helping school-teachers and administrators to develop a better understanding of problem behaviors in their schools as a pre-requisite to the development of more effective behaviors management practices from the perspective of psychological suzhi.

Guidelines for assessment of gait and reference values for spatiotemporal gait parameters in older adults: The biomathics and canadian gait consortiums initiative,2017,115,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027844497&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00353&partnerID=40&md5=d78106e101ac1f14d61f90d6420a9a70,"Background: Gait disorders, a highly prevalent condition in older adults, are associated with several adverse health consequences. Gait analysis allows qualitative and quantitative assessments of gait that improves the understanding of mechanisms of gait disorders and the choice of interventions. This manuscript aims (1) to give consensus guidance for clinical and spatiotemporal gait analysis based on the recorded footfalls in older adults aged 65 years and over, and (2) to provide reference values for spatiotemporal gait parameters based on the recorded footfalls in healthy older adults free of cognitive impairment and multi-morbidities. Methods: International experts working in a network of two different consortiums (i.e., Biomathics and Canadian Gait Consortium) participated in this initiative. First, they identified items of standardized information following the usual procedure of formulation of consensus findings. Second, they merged databases including spatiotemporal gait assessments with GAITRite® system and clinical information from the “Gait, cOgnitiOn & Decline” (GOOD) initiative and the Generation 100 (Gen 100) study. Only healthy—free of cognitive impairment and multi-morbidities (i.e., ≤ 3 therapeutics taken daily)—participants aged 65 and older were selected. Age, sex, body mass index, mean values, and coefficients of variation (CoV) of gait parameters were used for the analyses. Results: Standardized systematic assessment of three categories of items, which were demographics and clinical information, and gait characteristics (clinical and spatiotemporal gait analysis based on the recorded footfalls), were selected for the proposed guidelines. Two complementary sets of items were distinguished: a minimal data set and a full data set. In addition, a total of 954 participants (mean age 72.8 ± 4.8 years, 45.8% women) were recruited to establish the reference values. Performance of spatiotemporal gait parameters based on the recorded footfalls declined with increasing age (mean values and CoV) and demonstrated sex differences (mean values). Conclusions: Based on an international multicenter collaboration, we propose consensus guidelines for gait assessment and spatiotemporal gait analysis based on the recorded footfalls, and reference values for healthy older adults. © 2017 Beauchet, Allali, Sekhon, Verghese, Guilain, Steinmetz, Kressig, Barden, Szturm, Launay, Grenier, Bherer, Liu-Ambrose, Chester, Callisaya, Srikanth, Léonard, De Cock, Sawa, Duque, Camicioli and Helbostad.",0.46846846846846846

Imaging studies suggest the engagement of fronto-limbic regions like amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and lateral prefrontal cortex, is related to negatively biased attention. However, neural correlates of attentional bias for negative stimuli in individuals with subthreshold depression (SubD), that is individuals who have clinically relevant depressive symptoms but do not fulfill the criteria for MDD, remain unclear. Here, we used functional neuroimaging and the dot-probe task to elucidate the neural substrates of negatively biased attention among individuals with SubD. Behavioral results found that individuals with SubD allocated more attention toward negative stimuli relative to neutral stimuli, which were not observed among non-depressed controls (NCs). Imaging results found greater amygdala and rostral ACC activity in attentional bias toward negative stimuli among participants with SubD compared to NCs; Additionally, participants with SubD showed reduced engagement of bilateral inferior frontal gyrus compared with NCs in the attentional processing of negative stimuli. Together, these results suggest that alteration of fronto-limbic systems relative to controls, known to be related to negative detection and attentional control, is associated with negatively biased attention in individuals with SubD. © 2017 Li, Wei, Sun, Zhang and Qiu.",0.42

In a preliminary experiment, vertical rods of similar angular extents that were either large (4.5-7.5 m) and far, or small (0.9 -1.5 m) and near, were matched to horizontal extents in a virtual environment by adjustment of horizontal gaps or rods. Large/far objects showed a larger HVI (~13%) than did small objects (~7%), as has been shown before, but the horizontal gap normally used to measure the large-scale HVI was not the source of the larger bias. In the second experiment, we found that simply separating the comparison rod in depth from the vertical rod (thus forcing an evaluation of size at a distance) was sufficient to produce a large HVI (17%), even with small rods. The results are interpreted in light of evidence that the large-scale HVI is dependent on ground plane orientation and may be related to differential angular expansion in the visual coding of elevation and azimuth. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.38333333333333336

Here, we examined the influence of the DE on the LVF superiority for faces using event-related potentials. Twenty left-eye-dominant (LDE group) and 23 right-eye-dominant (RDE group) participants performed the experiments. Face stimuli were randomly presented in the LVF or right visual field (RVF). The RDE group exhibited significantly larger N170 amplitudes compared with the LDE group. Faces presented in the LVF elicited N170 amplitudes that were significantlymore negative in the RDE group than they were in the LDE group, whereas the amplitudes elicited by stimuli presented in the RVF were equivalent between the groups. The LVF superiority wasmaintained in the RDE group but not in the LDE group. Our results provide the first neural evidence of the DE's effects on the LVF superiority for faces.

Here, we examine how the Dark Triad traits (i.e., psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism) relate to two measures of individual differences in life history strategies. In Study 1 (N = 937), we replicated prior observed links between life history strategies, as measured by the Mini-K, and the Dark Triad traits using samples recruited from three countries. In Study 2 (N = 1032), we measured life history strategies using the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale and correlated it with the Dark Triad traits in samples recruited from three additional countries. While there was some variability across participants' sex and country, the results were generally consistent in that psychopathy and (to a lesser extent) Machiavellianism were related to faster life history strategies and narcissism was related to slower life history strategies.

The current study examined the effects of monetary incentive on both behavioral performance and electrophysiological activity among individuals varying in disinhibition and sensation seeking. The monetary incentive delay (MID) task was completed under electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Behavioral data showed that higher disinhibition and sensation-seeking were associated with lower performance accuracy. Event-related potential (ERP) data showed that high reinforcement cues elicited a larger late positive component (LPC) than other conditions among high disinhibition participants, indicating its strong emotional influence. Additionally, in the neutral incentive condition, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) elicited by correct outcomes was larger than that elicited by incorrect outcomes in the high disinhibition group only. This novel finding indicates that high disinhibition participants were less likely to expect correct outcomes compared to incorrect outcomes in the neutral incentive condition. Finally, the P3 component elicited by outcome presentation showed an interaction between two impulsivity dimensions; when disinhibition level was low, the P3 was larger among high than low sensation seeking participants. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.43548387096774194
Using large-scale statistical chinese brain template (Chinese2020) in popular neuroimage analysis toolkits,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027884764&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00414&partnerID=40&md5=7de6db49526337c67f8b37422e339596,"Given that the morphology of Chinese brains statistically differs from that of Caucasian, there is an urgent need to develop a Chinese brain template for neuroimaging studies in Chinese populations. Based on a multi-center dataset, we developed a statistical Chinese brain template, named as Chinese2020 (Liang et al., 2015). This new Chinese brain atlas has been validated in brain normalization and segmentation for anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies, and is publicly available at http://www.chinese-brain-atlases.org/. In our previous study, we have demonstrated this Chinese atlas showed higher accuracy in segmentation and relatively smaller shape deformations during registration. Because the spatial normalization of functional images is mainly based on the segmentation and normalization of anatomical image, the population-specific brain atlas should also be more appropriate for functional studies involving Chinese populations. The aim of this technology report is to validate the performance of Chinsese2020 template in functional neuroimaging studies, and demonstrated that for Chinese population studies, the use of the Chinese2010 template produces more valid results. The steps of how to use the Chinese2020 template in SPM software were given in details in this technology report, and based on an example of finger tapping fMRI study, this technology report demonstrated the Chinese2020 template could improve the performance of the neuroimaging analysis of Chinese populations. © 2017 Shi, Liang, Luo, Liu, Mok, Chu, Wang and Li.",0.4072398190045249

Results from surveys and archival data of 126 hotels showed that when hotels were owned and operated by brands, HPWS-SQs had a positive effect on service performance. Moderated mediation analyses showed that service performance as a mediator accounted for the moderating effect of ownership and management structure on the relationship between HPWS-SQs and hotel profitability. In addition, service performance demonstrated an inverted U-shaped relationship with hotel profitability. These findings advanced the understanding of the boundary conditions and influence processes of HPWS-SQs on financial performance in service settings. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.48905109489051096
Predicting semantic features in Chinese: Evidence from ERPs,2017,23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020898241&doi=10.1016%2fj.cognition.2017.06.010&partnerID=40&md5=b187eb1a58de535922a40d0f24b4e8a1,"This article reports two ERP studies that exploited the classifier system of Mandarin Chinese to investigate semantic prediction. In Mandarin, in certain contexts, a noun has to be preceded by a classifier, which has to match the noun in semantically-defined features. In both experiments, an N400 effect was elicited in response to a classifier that mismatched an up-coming predictable noun, relative to a matching classifier. Among the mismatching classifiers, the N400 effect was graded, being smaller for classifiers that were semantically related to the predicted word, relative to classifiers that were semantically unrelated to the predicted word. Given that the classifier occurred before the predicted word, this result shows that fine-grained semantic features of nouns can be pre-activated in advance of bottom-up input. The studies thus extend previous findings based on a more restricted range of highly grammaticalized features such as gender or animacy in Indo-European languages (Szewczyk & Schriefers, 2013; Van Berkum, Brown, Zwitserlood, Kooijman, & Hagoort, 2005; Wicha, Bates, Moreno, & Kutas, 2003). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.35403726708074534
The role of spatial frequency information in face classification by race,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028453819&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01152&partnerID=40&md5=043213a288db69cc53b790f5b45b4775,"It was found that face classification by race is more quickly for other-race than own-race faces (other-race classification advantage, ORCA). Controlling the spatial frequencies of face images, the current study investigated the perceptual processing differences based on spatial frequencies between own-race and other-race faces that might account for the ORCA. Regardless of the races of the observers, the own-race faces were classified faster and more accurately for broad-band faces than for both lower and higher spatial frequency (SF) faces, whereas, although other-race faces were classified less accurately for higher SF than for either broad-band or lower SF faces, there was no difference between broad-band and lower SF conditions of other-race faces. Although it was not evident for higher SF condition, the ORCA was more evident for lower SF than that for broad-band faces. The present data indicate that global/configural information is needed for subordinate race categorization of faces and that an important source of ORCA is application of global/configural computations by default while categorizing an own-race face but not while categorizing an other-race face. © 2017 Zhang, Wang, Wu and Zhao.",0.5083798882681564
Qualitatively coherent representation makes decision-making easier with binary-colored multi-attribute tables: An eye-tracking study,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027709638&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01388&partnerID=40&md5=327c246e26f1d70e0f5da545d77f68ea,"We aimed to identify the ways in which coloring cells affected decision-making in the context of binary-colored multi-attribute tables, using eye movement data. In our black-white attribute tables, the value of attributes was limited to two (with a certain threshold for each attribute) and each cell of the table was colored either black or white on the white background. We compared the two natural ways of systematic color assignment: ""quantitatively coherent"" ways and ""qualitatively coherent"" ways (namely, the ways in which the black-white distinction represented the quantitative amount distinction, and the ways in which the black-white distinction represented the quality distinction). The former consists of the following two types: (Type 1) ""larger is black,"" where the larger value-level was represented by black, and ""smaller is white,"" and (Type 2) ""smaller is black."" The latter consisted of the following two types: (Type 3) ""better is black,"" and (Type 4) ""worse is black."" We obtained the following two findings. [Result 1] The qualitatively coherent black-white tables (Types 3 and 4) made decision-making easier than the quantitatively coherent ones (Types 1 and 2). [Result 2] Among the two qualitatively coherent types, the ""black is better"" tables (Type 3) made decision making easier; in fact, the participants focused on the more important (black) cells in the case of ""black is better"" tables (Type 3) while they did not focus enough on the more important (white) ones in the case of the ""white is better"" tables (Type 4). We also examined some measures of eye movement patterns and showed that these measures supported our hypotheses. The data showed differences in the eye movement patterns between the first and second halves of each trial, which indicated the phased or combined decision strategies taken by the participants. © 2017 Morii, Ideno, Takemura and Okada.",0.45390070921985815
Evaluating the sources and functions of gradiency in phoneme categorization: An individual differences approach,2017,46,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017400366&doi=10.1037%2fxhp0000410&partnerID=40&md5=4aff4037acd2a9e533a65e11ee330c89,"During spoken language comprehension listeners transform continuous acoustic cues into categories (e.g., /b/ and /p/). While long-standing research suggests that phonetic categories are activated in a gradient way, there are also clear individual differences in that more gradient categorization has been linked to various communication impairments such as dyslexia and specific language impairments (Joanisse, Manis, Keating, & Seidenberg, 2000; López-Zamora, Luque, álvarez, & Cobos, 2012; Serniclaes, Van Heghe, Mousty, Carré, & Sprenger-Charolles, 2004; Werker & Tees, 1987). Crucially, most studies have used 2-alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks to measure the sharpness of betweencategory boundaries. Here we propose an alternative paradigm that allows us to measure categorization gradiency in a more direct way. Furthermore, we follow an individual differences approach to (a) link this measure of gradiency to multiple cue integration, (b) explore its relationship to a set of other cognitive processes, and (c) evaluate its role in individuals' ability to perceive speech in noise. Our results provide validation for this new method of assessing phoneme categorization gradiency and offer preliminary insights into how different aspects of speech perception may be linked to each other and to more general cognitive processes. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.44324324324324327
Individual differences in the accuracy of judgments of learning are related to the gray matter volume and functional connectivity of the left mid-insula,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027875815&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00399&partnerID=40&md5=0fb454ff5b6c7ae8913856c455a17300,"The judgment of learning (JOL) is an important form of prospective metamemory judgment, and the biological basis of the JOL process is an important topic in metamemory research. Although previous task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have examined the brain regions underlying the JOL process, the neural correlates of individual differences in JOL accuracy require further investigation. This study used structural and resting-state functional MRI to investigate whether individual differences in JOL accuracy are related to the gray matter (GM) volume and functional connectivity of the bilateral insula and medial Brodmann area (BA) 11, which are assumed to be related to JOL accuracy. We found that individual differences in JOL accuracy were related to the GM volume of the left mid-insula and to the functional connectivity between the left mid-insula and various other regions, including the left superior parietal lobule/precuneus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule/intraparietal sulcus, right frontal pole and left parahippocampal gyrus/fusiform gyrus/cerebellum. Further analyses indicated that the functional connectivity related to individual differences in JOL accuracy could be divided into two factors and might support information integration and selective attention processes underlying accurate JOLs. In addition, individual differences in JOL accuracy were not related to the GM volume or functional connectivity of the medial BA 11. Our findings provide novel evidence for the role of the left mid-insula and its functional connectivity in the JOL process. © 2017 Hu, Liu, Chen, Zheng, Su, Wang, Lin and Luo.",0.42127659574468085

Two experiments conducted in South Korea supported this hypothesis across a variety of products (e.g., perfume and vodka). Men became more negative towards advertisements featuring female sexuality, and had reduced purchase intentions for those products, after thinking about their own mortality. Study 2 found that these effects were mediated by heightened disgust. Mortality thoughts did not impact women in either study. These findings uniquely demonstrate that thoughts of death interact with female sex-appeal to influence men’s consumer choices, and that disgust mediates these processes. Implications for the role of emotion, and cultural differences, in terror management, for attitudes toward female sexuality, and for marketing strategies are discussed. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.5072463768115942

Although many vibrotactile stimulators are commercially available, most are expensive. Objective: We developed a low-cost vibrotactile stimulation system using a Nintendo Wii Remote and a personal computer. In the present study, we examined the validity and accuracy of this vibrotactile stimulation system. Method: In the first experiment, we measured the linearity of vibration amplitude and changes in peak vibration frequency generated by the Wii Remote as a function of activation intensity. In the second experiment, the effect of vibrotactile stimuli applied to the dorsal surface of hand on two-point discrimination threshold at the index finger was examined in twelve participants. Results: The peak vibration frequency was about 150 Hz irrespective of vibration intensity, which would effectively activate fast adapting type II (FAII) cutaneous mechanical receptors. The two-point discrimination threshold measured at the third pad of the index finger decreased significantly when a near-threshold vibrotactile stimulus was applied to the dorsal hand, a response termed stochastic resonance (SR). These SR results are consistent with findings in the other sensory systems, such as auditory, visual, and somatosensory systems. Conclusion: This newly developed stimulation system produces controllable vibrotactile stimuli useful for study of the haptic sense. © 2017 Sugimoto and Sasaki.",0.4095238095238095

This paper presents epidemiological data from 22 low-, lower-middle-, upper-middle- and high-income countries.; METHOD: Data came from 25 representative population-based surveys conducted in 22 countries (2001-2011) as part of the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys initiative (n = 124 902). The presence of specific phobia as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition was evaluated using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.; RESULTS: The cross-national lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates of specific phobia were, respectively, 7.4% and 5.5%, being higher in females (9.8 and 7.7%) than in males (4.9% and 3.3%) and higher in high- and higher-middle-income countries than in low-/lower-middle-income countries. The median age of onset was young (8 years). Of the 12-month patients, 18.7% reported severe role impairment (13.3-21.9% across income groups) and 23.1% reported any treatment (9.6-30.1% across income groups). Lifetime co-morbidity was observed in 60.5% of those with lifetime specific phobia, with the onset of specific phobia preceding the other disorder in most cases (72.6%). Interestingly, rates of impairment, treatment use and co-morbidity increased with the number of fear subtypes.; CONCLUSIONS: Specific phobia is common and associated with impairment in a considerable percentage of cases. Importantly, specific phobia often precedes the onset of other mental disorders, making it a possible early-life indicator of psychopathology vulnerability.",0.4069264069264069

Specific emotions as mediators of the effect of intergroup contact on prejudice: findings across multiple participant and target groups,2017,43,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969894785&doi=10.1080%2f02699931.2016.1182893&partnerID=40&md5=531a942174fab1e24392e90ad4d5cac4,"Emotions are increasingly being recognised as important aspects of prejudice and intergroup behaviour. Specifically, emotional mediators play a key role in the process by which intergroup contact reduces prejudice towards outgroups. However, which particular emotions are most important for prejudice reduction, as well as the consistency and generality of emotion–prejudice relations across different in-group–out-group relations, remain uncertain. To address these issues, in Study 1 we examined six distinct positive and negative emotions as mediators of the contact–prejudice relations using representative samples of U.S. White, Black, and Asian American respondents (N = 639). Admiration and anger (but not other emotions) were significant mediators of the effects of previous contact on prejudice, consistently across different perceiver and target ethnic groups. Study 2 examined the same relations with student participants and gay men as the out-group. Admiration and disgust mediated the effect of past contact on attitude. The findings confirm that not only negative emotions (anger or disgust, based on the specific types of threat perceived to be posed by an out-group), but also positive, status- and esteem-related emotions (admiration) mediate effects of contact on prejudice, robustly across several different respondent and target groups. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.5025641025641026

For this purpose, we devised a consecutive-change detection task wherein two successive testing probes were displayed after a single set of memory items. Across two experiments utilizing different memory-testing methods (whole vs. single probe), we observed a reliable pattern of poor performance in change detection for the second test when the first test had exhibited a color change. The impairment after a color change was evident even when the same memory item was repeatedly probed; this suggests that an attention-driven, salient visual change made it difficult to reinstate the previously remembered item. The second change detection, for memory items untested during the first change detection, was also found to be inaccurate, indicating that recognition-induced forgetting had occurred for the unprobed items in VWM. In a third experiment, we conducted a task that involved change detection plus continuous recall, wherein a memory recall task was presented after the change detection task. The analyses of the distributions of recall errors with a probabilistic mixture model revealed that the memory impairments from both visual changes and recognition-induced forgetting are explained better by the stochastic loss of memory items than by their degraded resolution. These results indicate that attention-driven visual change and recognition-induced forgetting jointly influence the “recycling” of VWM representations. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4980392156862745

However, whether the amount of exposure matters for this process has not been put to a direct test. We elucidated indicators of frequency-dependent perceptual attunement by comparing 5–8-month-old Dutch infants’ discrimination of tokens containing a highly frequent [hɪt-he:t] and a highly infrequent [hʏt-hø:t] native vowel contrast as well as a non-native [hɛt-hæt] vowel contrast in a behavioral visual habituation paradigm (Experiment 1). Infants discriminated both native contrasts similarly well, but did not discriminate the non-native contrast. We sought further evidence for subtle differences in the processing of the two native contrasts using near-infrared spectroscopy and a within-participant design (Experiment 2). The neuroimaging data did not provide additional evidence that responses to native contrasts are modulated by frequency of exposure. These results suggest that even large differences in exposure to a native contrast may not directly translate to behavioral and neural indicators of perceptual attunement, raising the possibility that frequency of exposure does not influence improvements in discriminating native contrasts. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.43478260869565216

One hundred stimuli were selected for each series and individually displayed on a computer screen, with presentation order randomized for each respondent. Respondents were then asked to rate their degree of preference for each stimulus. Mean preference scores increased over the first 10–20 trials, then, gradually decreased from the middle to the last trial.

Recent work showed that knowledge about the real underlying causal structure of a data generation process has implications for various machine learning settings. Assuming an additive noise and an independence between data generating mechanism and its input, we draw a novel connection between the intrinsic causal relationship of two variables and the expected prediction error. We formulate the theorem that the expected error of the true data generating function as prediction model is generally smaller when the effect is predicted from its cause and, on the contrary, greater when the cause is predicted from its effect. The theorem implies an asymmetry in the error depending on the prediction direction. This is further corroborated with empirical evaluations in artificial and real-world data sets. © 2017, The Behaviormetric Society.",0.5033112582781457

In the present research, we measured self-reported wealth (i.e., family income, Studies 1–3) and manipulated wealth using a “lucky draw” game (Studies 2 and 3) to examine how wealth affects responses to unfairness in an ultimatum game (Studies 1–3) and a new game called the cost-free rejection game (CFRG, Study 3). Across three studies, we found that wealthy people rejected an unfair offer (i.e., being offered 20% while the other kept 80% of the endowment) more frequently than the less wealthy, and that this tendency to reject unfairness was mediated by their increased feelings of entitlement. This suggests that the wealthy, or even people who temporarily perceive themselves to be wealthy, are more easily offended by unfairness than the less wealthy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.3465909090909091

Objective: Investigate the time-dependent effects of acute exercise on university students' processing speed, working memory and cognitive flexibility in temperate and cold environments. Method: Twenty male university students (age 23.5 ± 2.0 years) with moderate physical activity level participated in a repeated-measures within-subjects design. Processing speed, working memory and cognitive flexibility were assessed using CogState test battery at baseline (BASE), followed by a 45-min rest (REST), immediately after (EX) and 30 min after (POST-EX) 30-min moderate-intensity treadmill running in both temperate (TEMP; 25°C) and cold (COLD; 10°C) environments. Mean skin temperature (MST) and thermal sensation (TS) were also recorded. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed to analyze each variable. Spearman's rho was used to identify the correlations between MST, TS and cognitive performance. Results: Reaction time (RT) of processing speed and working memory decreased immediately after exercise in both conditions (processing speed: p = 0.003; working memory: p = 0.007). The facilitating effects on processing speed disappeared within 30 min after exercise in TEMP (p = 0.163) and COLD (p = 0.667), while improvements on working memory remained 30 min after exercise in TEMP (p = 0.047), but not in COLD (p = 0.663). Though RT of cognitive flexibility reduced in both conditions (p = 0.003), no significance was found between EX and REST (p = 0.135). Increased MST and TS were significantly associated with reductions in processing speed RT (MST: r = -0.341, p < 0.001; TS: r = -0.262, p = 0.001) and working memory RT (MST: r = -0.282, p < 0.001; TS: r = -0.2229, p = 0.005), and improvements in working memory accuracy (MST: r = 0.249, p = 0.002; TS: r = 0.255, p = 0.001). Conclusion: The results demonstrate different time-dependent effects of acute exercise on cognition in TEMP and COLD. Our study reveals facilitating effects of exercise on university students' processing speed and working memory in both environments. However, in contrast to TEMP, effects on working memory in COLD are transient. © 2017 Ji, Li, Liu, Sun, Wang, Chen and Gao.",0.4519230769230769
Differentiation of writing and drawing by U.S. two- to five-year-olds,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016576236&doi=10.1016%2fj.cogdev.2017.03.004&partnerID=40&md5=5f7e8e42022ee34fa974a1df2680f7c9,"To investigate preschoolers’ knowledge about symbol systems, we compared the written and drawn productions of 2–5-year-old U.S. children. In Study 1, children (N = 88) wrote and drew four targets, including their own name and a picture of themselves. Children differentiated writings from drawings in the implements they used, the size of their productions, and their use of recognizable letters. Some distinctions were present in the youngest children and others became more prominent with age. In Study 2, adults (N = 16) who judged whether the productions were writings or drawings performed above the level of chance for all age groups. Adults did better for children's names and self-portraits than for other targets, suggesting that the name plays a leading role in U.S. children's learning about writing. Overall, the results show that children begin to learn about formal differences between writing and drawing at an early age. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.3776223776223776
A meta-analytic study of the neural systems for auditory processing of lexical tones,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027861679&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00375&partnerID=40&md5=3064a14b886a0f2fc6b9e40786ba94bf,"The neural systems of lexical tone processing have been studied for many years. However, previous findings have been mixed with regard to the hemispheric specialization for the perception of linguistic pitch patterns in native speakers of tonal language. In this study, we performed two activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses, one on neuroimaging studies of auditory processing of lexical tones in tonal languages (17 studies), and the other on auditory processing of lexical information in non-tonal languages as a control analysis for comparison (15 studies). The lexical tone ALE analysis showed significant brain activations in bilateral inferior prefrontal regions, bilateral superior temporal regions and the right caudate, while the control ALE analysis showed significant cortical activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left temporoparietal regions. However, we failed to obtain significant differences from the contrast analysis between two auditory conditions, which might be caused by the limited number of studies available for comparison. Although the current study lacks evidence to argue for a lexical tone specific activation pattern, our results provide clues and directions for future investigations on this topic, more sophisticated methods are needed to explore this question in more depth as well. © 2017 Kwok, Dan, Yakpo, Matthews, Fox, Li and Tan.",0.495
Dimensions of emotional intelligence and online gaming addiction in adolescence: The indirect effects of two facets of perceived stress,2017,37,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023173487&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01206&partnerID=40&md5=d10df55c25be13f149e73c854f6ce33c,"This study tested a parallel two-mediator model in which the relationship between dimensions of emotional intelligence and online gaming addiction are mediated by perceived helplessness and perceived self-efficacy, respectively. The sample included 931 male adolescents (mean age = 16.18 years, SD = 0.95) from southern China. Data on emotional intelligence (four dimensions, including self-management of emotion, social skills, empathy and utilization of emotions), perceived stress (two facets, including perceived self-efficacy and perceived helplessness) and online gaming addiction were collected, and bootstrap methods were used to test this parallel two-mediator model. Our findings revealed that perceived self-efficacy mediated the relationship between three dimensions of emotional intelligence (i.e., self-management, social skills, and empathy) and online gaming addiction, and perceived helplessness mediated the relationship between two dimensions of emotional intelligence (i.e., self-management and emotion utilization) and online gaming addiction. These findings underscore the importance of separating the four dimensions of emotional intelligence and two facets of perceived stress to understand the complex relationship between these factors and online gaming addiction. © 2017 Che, Hu, Zhen, Yu, Li, Chang and Zhang.",0.5

The strongest negative correlation with sense of coherence was stigmatizing words from others; there were positive correlations with social capital and perceived positive change. Multiple regression showed that to be aware of positive changes, mothers share their feelings with mothers in the same position, are rooted in a safe community and do not feel isolated in parenting.

Mating Goals Moderate Power’s Effect on Conspicuous Consumption Among Women,2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047520093&doi=10.1177%2f1474704917723912&partnerID=40&md5=8c6f74cb1898b2a58e742804e25bdd8d,"This study aimed to use evolutionary psychology to explain conspicuous consumption’s relationship with mating goals among women. We used experiments to show that power moderates conspicuous consumption’s relationship with mating goals among women through an underlying relationship with women’s social comparison tendencies. In Study 1, the participants read a passage describing a young woman wearing a coat made by a conspicuous brand (vs. an ordinary brand) who aimed to attract a desired man (vs. aiming to guard against potential competitors’ attempts to disrupt her established intimate relationship). Participants in the conspicuous-brand condition were more confident that the young woman would succeed in mate attraction and guarding than participants in the ordinary-brand condition, suggesting the participants believed the conspicuous brands facilitated mate attraction and mate guarding more than ordinary brands. Study 2 manipulated the participants’ power states and mating goals and measured participants’ social comparison tendencies and conspicuous consumption index values. In the mate-guarding condition, high-power participants showed more inclination toward conspicuous consumption than low-power participants. In the mate-attraction condition, low-power participants showed a greater inclination toward conspicuous consumption than did high-power participants. Comparison orientation also mediated power’s effect on conspicuous consumption inclination. The evolutionary psychological basis for the above findings is discussed, and suggestions are offered regarding product marketing. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.5167464114832536

Recent neuroimaging studies have begun to identify IA-related changes in specific brain regions and connections. However, whether and how the interactions within and between the large-scale brain networks are disrupted in individuals with IA remain largely unexplored. Using group independent component analysis, we extracted five intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from the resting-state fMRI data of 26 adolescents with IA and 43 controls, including the anterior and posterior default mode network (DMN), left and right fronto-parietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN). We then examined the possible group differences in the functional connectivity within each ICN and between the ICNs. We found that, compared with controls, IA subjects showed: (1) reduced inter-hemispheric functional connectivity of the right FPN, whereas increased intra-hemispheric functional connectivity of the left FPN; (2) reduced functional connectivity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the anterior DMN; (3) reduced functional connectivity between the SN and anterior DMN. Our findings suggest that IA is associated with imbalanced interactions among the DMN, FPN and SN, which may serve as system-level neural underpinnings for the uncontrollable Internet-using behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.4090909090909091

We assessed 106 4- to 7-year-old children and found that 4-year-olds were able to do non-symbolic addition but not symbolic addition. Five-year-olds and older were able to do symbolic addition and their performance in symbolic addition exceeded non-symbolic addition in grade 1 (approximate age 7). These results suggested non-symbolic addition ability emerges earlier and is less affected by formal mathematical education than symbolic addition. Meanwhile, we tested children's bi-directional mapping ability using a novel task and found that children were able to map between symbolic and non-symbolic representations of number at age 5. Their ability in mapping non-symbolic to symbolic number became more proficient in grade 1 (approximate age 7). This suggests children at age 7 have developed a relatively mature symbolic representation system. © 2017 Li, Zhang, Chen, Zhu, Deng and Yan.",0.5342465753424658

Our findings indicated that (1) LMX mediated the positive relationship between ethical leadership and feedback seeking from both ethical leaders and coworkers, and (2) emotional intelligence and work-unit structure served as joint moderators on the mediated positive relationship in such a way that the relationship was strongest when the emotional intelligence was high and work-unit structure was more of an organic structure rather than a mechanistic structure. © 2017 Qian, Wang, Han and Song.",0.4339622641509434

The individual predisposition towards the enjoyment of cognitive activity is called need for cognition (NFC), and individuals high in NFC tend to seek out and engage in cognitive activity spontaneously. The present study examined the influence of NFC and limiting instructions about emotional evidence on mock jurors’ legal decision-making. The results showed that mock jurors who were lower in NFC were more likely to render a guilty decision than those higher in NFC, and that the tendency was more salient when the limiting instructions were presented compared with when they were not presented. Similar results were found in regard to sentencing decisions and arousal of anger. A partial mediation effect of anger was found between NFC and verdict decisions. The influence of NFC on the limiting instructions and legal decision-making as well as the effect of anger on the decision is discussed in relation to these results. © 2017 The Australian and New Zealand Association of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law.",0.45161290322580644

Process-focus encourages consumers to focus their thoughts on the process of reaching an outcome, thereby affecting extension evaluations on the basis of the process similarity between the original brand and its extensions. Conversely, outcome-focus encourages consumers to focus their thoughts on the final outcome, thereby affecting extension evaluations on the basis of the final outcome similarity between the original brand and its extensions. With this conceptual framework, the present research demonstrated that for the process-focus condition, the extension was evaluated more favorably when the similarity between the process of the original brand and the process of its extension was present (Study 1). By contrast, for the outcome-focus condition, the extension was evaluated more favorably when the similarity between the final outcome of the original brand and the final outcome of its extension was present (Study 2). © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

A total of 181 children (85 girls and 96 boys) from rural China were assessed when they were in Grades 1 and 2. Path analyses controlling for maternal education indicated that effortful control at the beginning of Grade 1 predicted incremental achievement in literacy and mathematics at the end of Grade 1 and mathematics achievement at the end of Grade 2. Growth in effortful control during Grade 1 also contributed significantly to the prediction of both literacy and mathematics achievement at the end of Grade 2. Although girls performed significantly better than boys in literacy achievement, gender did not moderate the relationships between effortful control and literacy and mathematics achievement. Practice or Policy: Children’s effortful control appears to be an important predictor of early literacy and mathematics achievement. Findings suggest that children’s effortful control should be fostered during the preschool and early years of formal schooling, and this can be done in both home and school contexts. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",0.4666666666666667
Strong functional connectivity among homotopic brain areas is vital for motor control in unilateral limb movement,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027888763&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00366&partnerID=40&md5=ba7fd298e10a4be3d2d0feae64638615,"The mechanism underlying brain region organization for motor control in humans remains poorly understood. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, right-handed volunteers were tasked to maintain unilateral foot movements on the right and left sides as consistently as possible. We aimed to identify the similarities and differences between brain motor networks of the two conditions. We recruited 18 right-handed healthy volunteers aged 25 ± 2.3 years and used a whole-body 3T system for magnetic resonance (MR) scanning. Image analysis was performed using SPM8, Conn toolbox and Brain Connectivity Toolbox. We determined a craniocaudally distributed, mirror-symmetrical modular structure. The functional connectivity between homotopic brain areas was generally stronger than the intrahemispheric connections, and such strong connectivity led to the abovementioned modular structure. Our findings indicated that the interhemispheric functional interaction between homotopic brain areas is more intensive than the interaction along the conventional top–down and bottom–up pathways within the brain during unilateral limb movement. The detected strong interhemispheric horizontal functional interaction is an important aspect of motor control but often neglected or underestimated. The strong interhemispheric connectivity may explain the physiological phenomena and effects of promising therapeutic approaches. Further accurate and effective therapeutic methods may be developed on the basis of our findings. © 2017 Wei, Zhang, Lv and Jing.",0.47804878048780486

A bibliometric report that identifies the most-cited articles within the body of the relevant literature may provide insight and guidance for readers toward scientific topics that are considered important for researchers and all relevant workers of academia. To our knowledge, there is a lack of an overall evaluation of the most-cited articles and hence of a comprehensive review of major research topics in neuroscience. The present study was therefore proposed to analyze and characterize the 100 most-cited articles in neuroscience. Methods: Based on data provided from Web of Science, the 100 most-cited articles relevant to neuroscience were identified and characterized. Information was extracted for each included article to assess for the publication year, journal published, impact factor, adjusted impact factor, citation count (total, normalized, and adjusted), reference list, authorship and article type. Results: The total citation count for the 100 most-cited articles ranged from 7,326 to 2,138 (mean 3087.0) and the normalized citation count ranged from 0.163 to 0.007 (mean 0.054). The majority of the 100 articles were research articles (67%) and published from 1996 to 2000 (30%). The author and journal with the largest share of these 100 articles were Stephen M. Smith (n = 6) and Science (n = 13) respectively. Among the 100 most-cited articles, 37 were interlinked via citations of one another, and they could be classified into five major topics, four of which were scientific topics, namely neurological disorders, prefrontal cortex/emotion/reward, brain network, and brain mapping. The remaining topic was methodology. Interestingly 41 out of 63 of the rest, non-interlinked articles could also be categorized under the above five topics. Adjusted journal impact factor among these 100 articles did not appear to be associated with the corresponding adjusted citation count. Conclusion: The current study compiles a comprehensive list and analysis of the 100 most-cited articles relevant to neuroscience that enables the comprehensive identification and recognition of the most important and relevant research topics concerned. © 2017 Yeung, Goto and Leung.",0.478125

The reduced yawn contagion observed in the autistic population suggested that it might be empathy related; however, it is unknown whether such a connection applies to nonclinical populations. We examined influences from both empathy (i.e., autistic traits) and nonempathy factors (i.e., individuals’ perceptual detection sensitivity to yawning, happy, and angry faces) on 41 nonclinical adults. We induced contagious yawning with a 5-minute video and 20 yawning photo stimuli. In addition, we measured participants’ autistic traits (with the autism-spectrum quotient questionnaire), eye gaze patterns, and their perceptual thresholds to detect yawning and emotion in human face photos. We found two factors associated with yawning contagion: (a) those more sensitive to detect yawning, but not other emotional expressions, displayed more contagious yawning than those less sensitive to yawning expressions, and (b) female participants exhibited significantly more contagious yawning than male participants. We did not find an association between autistic trait and contagious yawning. Our study offers a working hypothesis for future studies, in that perceptual encoding of yawning interacts with susceptibility to contagious yawning. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.453125

These contrasting claims were addressed in 2 studies conducted among Japanese, Indian, and American adults. Assessing everyday social support, Study 1 showed that Japanese and Americans rely on exchange norms more frequently than Indians among friends, whereas American rely on exchange norms more frequently than Indians and Japanese among siblings. Assessing responses to vignettes, Study 2 demonstrated that Japanese and Americans rely more frequently on exchange norms than Indians, with greatest relational concerns and most negative outlooks on social support observed among Japanese, less among Americans, and least among Indians. Results further indicated that relational concerns mediated the link between exchange norms and negative social support outlooks. Supporting past claims that relational concerns explain cultural variation in discomfort in social support (e.g., Kim, Sherman, & Taylor, 2008), the findings underscore the need to take into account as well the role of exchange norms in explaining such discomfort. The findings also highlight the existence of culturally variable approaches to exchange and call into question claims that discomfort in social support can be explained in terms of the global concept of an interdependent cultural view of self. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.43103448275862066
Perceived prejudice and the mental health of Chinese ethnic minority college students: The chain mediating effect of ethnic identity and hope,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85022335145&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01167&partnerID=40&md5=46ea5f98e86c22306f867317604828b8,"As a multinational country incorporating 56 officially recognized ethnic groups, China is concerned with the mental health of members of minority ethnic groups, with an increasing focus on supporting Chinese ethnic minority college students. Nevertheless, in daily life, members of minority ethnic groups in China often perceive prejudice, which may in turn negatively influence their mental health, with respect to relative levels of ethnic identity and hope. To examine the mediating effects of ethnic identity and hope on the relationship between perceived prejudice and the mental health of Chinese ethnic minority college students, 665 students (18-26 years old; 207 males, 458 females; the proportion of participants is 95.38%) from nine colleges in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces of China took part in our study, each completing adapted versions of a perceived prejudice scale, a multiethnic identity measure, an adult dispositional hope scale, and a general health questionnaire. Analysis of the results reveals that perceived prejudice negatively influences mental health through both ethnic identity and hope in Chinese ethnic minority college students. The total mediation effect was 54.9%. Perceived prejudice was found to negatively predict ethnic identity and hope, suggesting that perceived prejudice brings about a negative reconstruction of ethnic identity and hope mechanisms within the study's Chinese cultural context. The relationship between perceived prejudice and mental health was fully mediated by hope and the chain of ethnic identity and hope. Ethnic identity partially mediated the relationship between perceived prejudice and hope. The relationship between perceived prejudice and mental health mediated by ethnic identity was not significant, which suggests that the rejection-identification model cannot be applied to Chinese ethnic minority college students. This paper concludes by considering the limitations of our study and discussing the implications of its results for researchers and practitioners. © 2017 Yao and Yang.",0.5802047781569966
Coping strategies & benefit-finding in the relationship between non-disclosure & depressive symptoms among breast cancer survivors in China,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020442858&doi=10.5993%2fAJHB.41.4.1&partnerID=40&md5=1e66281135ce1184b3bfd7f3a257fb98,"Objective: Open communication about cancer diagnosis and relevant stress is frequently avoided among breast cancer survivors in China. Non-disclosure behavior may lead to negative psychological consequences. We aimed to examine the relationship between non-disclosure and depressive symptoms, and the role of coping strategies and benefit-finding in that relationship among Chinese breast cancer survivors. Methods: Using convenience sampling, we recruited 148 women in an early survivorship phase (up to 6 years post-Treatment) in Nanjing, China. Participants were asked to complete a set of questionnaires in Chinese language, regarding sociodemographic characteristics, depressive symptoms, disclosure views, coping strategies, and benefit-finding. Results: A higher level of non-disclosure was associated with more depressive symptoms. This relationship was mediated by self-blame and moderated by benefit-finding. Specifically, nondisclosure was associated with depressive symptoms through self-blame. The impact of non-disclosure was minimized among the women with a higher level of benefit-finding. Conclusion: Unexpressed cancer-related concern may increase selfblame, which leads to emotional distress among Chinese breast cancer survivors. Practicing benefit-finding may reduce the negative impact of non-disclosure. As a culturally appropriate way of disclosure, written expression may be beneficial to Chinese breast cancer patients.

We hypothesized that residents of Shenzhen are more independent than those in other regions of Mainland China.

Perceived residential environment of neighborhood and subjective well-being among the elderly in China: A mediating role of sense of community,2017,99,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015625025&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvp.2017.03.004&partnerID=40&md5=56d9e0853a3ff804ae1d7a78f466c90b,"An accumulating body of literature has shown the influence of neighborhood environment on well-being. This study investigated the relationship between perceived neighborhood environment and subjective well-being and the mediating effect of a sense of community among Chinese elderly. Subjective well-being included four indicators: life satisfaction, meaning in life, positive affect, and negative affect. The Perceived Residential Environment Scale assessed physical and functional aspects as material conditions of neighborhood. The Sense of Community scale was drawn from the Community Social Capital survey based on urban residents of China. Seven hundred and twenty community-dwelling older adults participated in this investigation. The results showed that the neighborhood environment related positively to life satisfaction, meaning in life, and positive affect but negatively to negative affect; sense of community partially mediated the relationship between the neighborhood environment and life satisfaction and fully mediated the relationship between neighborhood environment and meaning in life and positive affect. © 2017",0.5333333333333333
Avoidance of bereavement-related stimuli in Chinese individuals experiencing prolonged grief: Evidence from a dot-probe task,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025455662&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01201&partnerID=40&md5=0cc8ff3ec34d11bd016e9470a7fc5593,"Background: Attentional bias refers to a preference for (e.g., vigilance) or a shifting away (e.g., avoidance) of one's focus with respect to specific stimuli. Accumulating evidence suggests that an attentional bias toward death/threat-related stimuli exists in bereaved individuals experiencing prolonged grief (PG). Measuring for different processing may reflect different cognitive characteristics. Therefore, this study sought to compare information-processing biases in Chinese individuals with high versus low levels of PG symptomatology at supraliminal and subliminal levels, respectively. Method: A 2 (grief level) × 2 (consciousness level) × 2 (word type) three-factor mixed design with supraliminal and subliminal tasks was utilized in the current study. Based on their Prolonged Grief Questionnaire-13 (PG-13) scores, 38 participants were included in the low-PG group, and 34 individuals were included in the high-PG group. All the participants completed a dot-probe task in which they were primed with death-related and life-related words paired with neutral stimuli. Results: High-PG individuals were slower in reacting to the death-related information in both supraliminal and subliminal tasks. After controlling for other symptoms in the backward deletion regression, PG-13 scores significantly predicted the avoidance tendency to death-related words in the supraliminal task, while anxiety was the best predictor of turning one's vision away from death-related stimuli in the subliminal trials. Conclusion: The results suggested that high PG is associated with a tendency to avoid death-related words. Future research is needed to explore interventions that address the avoidance of death-related stimuli among individuals with elevated, or diagnosable, levels of PG. © 2017 Yu, Tang, Wang, Xiang, Yu, Xu, Wang and Prigerson.",0.39759036144578314
"Spanking and subsequent behavioral problems in toddlers: A propensity score-matched, prospective study in Japan",2017,35,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018587629&doi=10.1016%2fj.chiabu.2017.04.002&partnerID=40&md5=1aaec9da184ed24d12b3e1e59cef669b,"Harsh or frequent spanking in early childhood is an established risk factor for later childhood behavioral problems as well as mental disorder in adulthood in Western societies. However, few studies have been conducted in Asian populations, where corporal punishment is relatively accepted. Moreover, the impacts of occasional spanking on subsequent behavioral problems remain uncertain. This study sought to investigate prospectively the association between the frequency of spanking of toddlers and later behavioral problems in Japanese children using national birth cohort data. We used data from the Longitudinal Survey of Newborns in the 21st Century, a population-based birth cohort data set collected by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (N = 29,182). Frequency of spanking (“never”, “sometimes” and “always”) and child behavioral problems were assessed via a caregiver questionnaire when the child was 3.5 years old and again at 5.5 years. Propensity score matching was used to examine the association between frequency of spanking and child behavioral problems, adjusting for parental socioeconomic status, child temperament and parenting behaviors. Compared to children who were never spanked, occasional spanking (“sometimes”) showed a higher number of behavioral problems (on a 6-point scale) (coefficient: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.07–0.15), and frequent spanking (“always”) showed an even larger number of behavioral problems compared with “sometimes” (coefficient: 0.08, 95% CI:0.01–0.16). Spanking of any self-reported frequency was associated with an increased risk for later behavioral problems in children. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.39285714285714285

However, the situation is much more complex in three-party or multi-party interactions. De Hooge et al. (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 100, 2011 and 462) found that guilt could not only induce pro-social behaviour towards the victim, but also have a disadvantageous impact on a third party. In the present study, we attempt to explain how guilt promotes unfair allocations from a moral foundations perspective. We conducted two experiments using a ‘three-party dictator game’ paradigm. Firstly, it was repeatedly verified that guilt could induce unfair allocations in three-party interactions. Secondly, five moral foundations (harm, fairness, ingroup, hierarchy and purity) were measured. Then the moderating and main effects of these five indices on how guilt affects the fair allocation of resources were explored using regression analysis. The results show that competition between harm and fairness in individual traits can explain the disadvantageous effect of guilt on fair allocations: the fairness foundation promoted equality in allocation, while the harm foundation promoted victim compensation. © 2017 The Authors.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cue predictive values or the spatial correspondence learning between cues and targets could influence the sequence effect of symbolic cueing. The findings revealed that the predictive values of arrow or word cues do not lead to different sequence effects, but that visually asymmetrical letter cues, which allow spatial correspondence learning between cues and targets, induce stronger sequence effects than visually symmetrical letter cues. In addition, visually symmetrical directional word cues can induce sequence effects. The results suggest that spatial correspondence learning, although not obligatory, is critical for the sequence effects of symbolic cueing. The findings support the feature-integration hypothesis, rather than the strategic adjustments account. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

While template-based parcellations are widely used, the parcels on the template do not necessarily match individual’s functional nodes. A new method is developed to overcome the inconsistent network analysis results by by-passing the difficulties of parcellating the brain into functionally meaningful areas. First, roughly equal-sized parcellations are obtained. Second, these random parcellations are applied to individual subjects multiple times and a pseudo-bootstrap (PBS) of the network is obtained for statistical inferences. It was found that the variation of mean global network metrics from PBS sampling is smaller compared with inter-subject variation or within-subject variation between two diffusion MRI scans. Using the mean global network metrics from PBS sampling, the intra-class correlation is always higher than the average obtained from using a single random parcellation. As one application, the PBS method was tested on the Human Connectome Project resting state dataset to identify individuals across scan sessions based on the mean functional connectivity (FC)—a trivial network property that has little information about the connectivity between nodes. An accuracy rate of ∼90% was achieved by simply finding the maximum correlation of mean FC of PBS samples between two scan sessions. © 2017 Cheng, Li, Koenigsberger, Huang, Wang, Sheng and Newman.",0.4046511627906977

We also coded facial expression to characterise emotional response to learning. In a sample of nine-month-old healthy Chinese infants, 44.7% achieved learning threshold during this challenging arm-conditioning test. Some evidence of learning was observed at the beginning of the second task. The lowest period of negative emotions coincided with the period of maximum movement responses after the initiation of the second task, and movement responses negatively correlated with the frequency of negative emotions. Positive emotions, while generally low throughout the task, increased during peak performance especially for learners. Peak frequency of movement responses was positively correlated with the frequency of positive emotions. Despite the weak evidence of learning this difficult task, our results from the learners would suggest that increasing positive emotions, and perhaps down-regulating negative emotional responses, may be important for improving performance and learning a complex operant task in infancy. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of emotions in learning difficult tasks in infancy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.450261780104712
Neurodevelopmental hypothesis about the etiology of autism spectrum disorders,2017,32,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027848270&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00354&partnerID=40&md5=9ee435117f71b9bc9bce236f31ea57d0,"Previous models or hypotheses of autism spectral disorder (ASD) failed to take into full consideration the chronological and causal developmental trajectory, leading to the emergence of diverse phenotypes through a complex interaction between individual etiologies and environmental factors. Those phenotypes include persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction (criteria A in DSM-5), and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (criteria B in DSM-5). In this article, we proposed a domain-general model that can explain criteria in DSM-5 based on the assumption that the same etiological mechanism would trigger the various phenotypes observed in different individuals with ASD. In the model, we assumed the following joint causes as the etiology of autism: (1) Hypoplasia of the pons in the brainstem, occurring immediately following neural tube closure; and (2) Deficiency in the GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) developmental switch during the perinatal period. Microstructural abnormalities of the pons directly affect both the structural and functional development of the brain areas strongly connected to it, especially amygdala. The impairment of GABA switch could not only lead to the deterioration of inhibitory processing in the neural network, but could also cause abnormal cytoarchitecture. We introduced a perspective that atypical development in both brain structure and function can give full explanation of diverse phenotypes and pathogenetic mechanism of ASD. Finally, we discussed about neural mechanisms underlying the phenotypic characteristics of ASD that are not described in DSM-5 but should be considered as important foundation: sleep, global precedence, categorical perception, intelligence, interoception and motor control. © 2017 Inui, Kumagaya and Myowa-Yamakoshi.",0.39285714285714285
Measurement of the perception of control during continuous movement using electroencephalography,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027844612&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00392&partnerID=40&md5=afe26265966ebfb2637b3597e1950e3a,"“Sense of control” refers to the subjective feeling of control over external events. Numerous neuropsychological studies have investigated the neural basis of the sense of control during action performance; however, most previous studies have focused on responses to a single discrete action outcome rather than real-time processing of action-outcome sequences. In the present study, we aimed to identify whether certain patterns of brain activation are associated with the perceived control during continuous movement. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals while participants continuously moved a right-handed mouse in an attempt to control multiple visual stimuli. When participants perceived a sense of control over the stimuli, we observed a positive potential approximately 550 ms after the onset of movement, while no similar potential was observed when participants reported a lack of control. The appearance of this potential was consistent with the time window of awareness of control in a behavioral test using the same task, and likely reflected the explicit allocation of attention to control. Moreover, we found that the alpha-mu rhythm, which is linked to sensorimotor processing, was significantly suppressed after participants came to a conclusion regarding the level of control, regardless of whether control or lack of control was perceived. In summary, our results suggest that the late positive potential after the onset of the movement and the suppression of alpha-mu rhythm can be used as markers of the perception of control during continuous action performance and feedback monitoring. © 2017 Wen, Yamashita and Asama.",0.44398340248962653

This study analyzed the association between electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals in healthy individuals in an attempt to verify the differences between the two signals in corticomuscular connectivity as well as the time delay in the flow of information in accordance with the presence of movement intention. To examine the relationship between the brain and muscles, coherence and mutual information analyses were performed on the EEG signals in the motor cortex and EMG signals in the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle during grasping training. Coherence and mutual information between EEG and EMG signals were significantly higher and the time delay of information flow was shorter when subjects performed active exercise with movement intention than when they performed passive exercise without movement intention. These findings could be applied to the rehabilitation of stroke patients to develop a rehabilitative training system with heightened effectiveness through verification of the presence of movement intention in the patients. © 2017 The Authors",0.4791666666666667
The globalization of R&D's implications for technological capabilities in MNC home countries: Semiconductor design offshoring to China and India,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017457764&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2017.03.032&partnerID=40&md5=faf20d9454dbf7b121d83e7d778eb3b5,"This paper addresses the empirical question of the impact of the offshoring of semiconductor design to India and China on the generation of semiconductor design skills in the offshoring multinational corporations' (MNCs) home countries. There are four main findings. First, there is a specific technology skill ladder for training “design leads” or design managers within this industry that entails direct exposure to a wide range of design activities. Thus, offshoring has potentially serious implications for development of further design leads. Second, the paper also finds that the impact on skills activities and thus potential skills generation at home from offshoring to India has been limited and gradual and from offshoring to China has been even more limited although the activities done in each country by MNCs have risen over time. Third, the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis pinpoints that the operations with design leads and large design teams in 2003–2007 in conjunction with other attributes are generally the ones that pursued the most extensive expansion of semiconductor design offshoring during the subsequent 2009–2013 period. Finally, the evidence for a gradual process of offshoring from the second and third points suggests that offshoring in semiconductor design will most likely not displace the large amount of design activities in the home countries of the MNCs in the near future. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.41013824884792627
Association between the blood concentrations of ammonia and carnitine/amino acid of schizophrenic patients treated with valproic acid,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021697669&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0101-0&partnerID=40&md5=17a46874632f85683e1a9a92195770d3,"Background: Administration of valproic acid (VPA) is complicated with approximately 0.9% of patients developing hyperammonemia, but the pathogenesis of this adverse effect remains to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to search for mechanisms associated with VPA-induced hyperammonemia in the light of changes in serum amino acids concentrations associated with the urea cycle of schizophrenic patients. Method: Blood samples (10 mL) were obtained from 37 schizophrenic patients receiving VPA for the prevention of violent behaviors in the morning after overnight fast. Blood concentrations of ammonia, VPA, free carnitine, acyl-carnitine, and 40 amino acids including glutamate and citrulline were measured for each patient. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify amino acids or concomitantly administered drugs that were associated with variability in the blood concentrations of ammonia. Result: The blood ammonia level was positively correlated with the serum glutamate concentration (r = 0.44, p < 0.01) but negatively correlated with glutamine (r = -0.41, p = 0.01), citrulline (r = -0.42, p = 0.01), and glycine concentrations (r = -0.54, p < 0.01). It was also revealed that the concomitant administration of the mood stabilizers (p = 0.04) risperidone (p = 0.03) and blonanserin (p < 0.01) was positively associated with the elevation of the blood ammonia level. Conclusion: We hypothisized that VPA would elevate the blood ammonia level of schizophrenic patients. The observed changes in serum amino acids are compatible with urea cycle dysfunction, possibly due to reduced carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) activity. We conclude that VPA should be prudently prescribed to schizophrenic patients, particularly those receiving mood stabilizers or certain antipsychotics. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.4132231404958678

As religious people are more likely than less-religious people to perceive faces in everyday objects and as perception of face-like objects promotes prosociality, it was expected that religious people would become more prosocial when they perceived face-like objects. To test the hypothesis, the study replicated a past finding in a Japanese sample in which religious people tended to perceive a face in everyday objects. Next, results showed that the decision to donate in religious people (compared to less-religious people) was increased when a face-like object was displayed with charitable appeals. This effect was not observed with a non-face-like object. The current study indicates that interaction with the surrounding environment plays an important role in motivating prosocial behavior among religious people. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

Previous studies have provided evidence about the changes in cognitive control induced by mind-body training. However, the neural correlates underlying the effect of extensive mind-body practice on cognitive control remain largely unknown. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we characterized dynamic fluctuations in large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks associated with mind-body practice, and examined their differences between healthy controls and Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) practitioners. Compared with a control group, the TCC group revealed significantly decreased fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF) in the bilateral frontoparietal network, default mode network and dorsal prefrontal-angular gyri network. Furthermore, we detected a significant association between mind-body practice experience and fALFF in the default mode network, as well as an association between cognitive control performance and fALFF of the frontoparietal network. This provides the first evidence of large-scale functional connectivity in brain networks associated with mind-body practice, shedding light on the neural network changes that accompany intensive mind-body training.

Collinear masking effect in visual search is independent of perceptual salience,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015976403&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-017-1308-7&partnerID=40&md5=328a2d71a7eddff234e8dcd4364380d6,"Searching for a target in a salient region should be easier than looking for one in a nonsalient region. However, we previously discovered a contradictory phenomenon in which a local target in a salient structure was more difficult to find than one in the background. The salient structure was constructed of orientation singletons aligned to each other to form a collinear structure. In the present study, we undertake to determine whether such a masking effect was a result of salience competition between a global structure and the local target. In the first 3 experiments, we increased the salience value of the local target with the hope of adding to its competitive advantage and eventually eliminating the masking effect; nevertheless, the masking effect persisted. In an additional 2 experiments, we reduced salience of the global collinear structure by altering the orientation of the background bars and the masking effect still emerged. Our salience manipulations were validated by a controlled condition in which the global structure was grouped noncollinearly. In this case, local target salience increase (e.g., onset) or global distractor salience reduction (e.g., randomized flanking orientations) effectively removed the facilitation effect of the noncollinear structure. Our data suggest that salience competition is unlikely to explain the collinear masking effect, and other mechanisms such as contour integration, border formation, or the crowding effect may be prospective candidates for further investigation. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4434782608695652

Results demonstrated that (a) higher WMC indicated better attentional control (Experiments 1 and 2); (b) the effects of SA on attentional control were inconsistent because SA impaired attentional control in Experiment 1, but favored attentional control in Experiment 2; and (c) the interaction of SA and WMC was not significant (Experiments 1 and 2). This study directly manipulated WMC by working memory training, which provided more reliable evidence for controlled attention view of WMC and new supportive evidence for working memory training (i.e., far transfer effect on attentional control). And the refinement of the relationship between anxiety and attentional control proposed by Attentional Control Theory was also discussed. © 2017 Luo, Zhang and Wang.",0.5240963855421686

Materials and Methods: We collected the data of 10789 subjects and examined the relationship between L score or the number of characteristic biased persons and the parameters of age, sex, education level, occupation, and degree of pain. Furthermore, we examined the changes in extraversion-introversion (E score), neuroticism (N score), and L scores at approximately 1 year after surgery in 1711 patients who underwent surgery at our university hospital or affiliated hospitals. Results: L score was significantly higher among persons with a high degree of pain, and ratio of the characteristic biased persons in L score was significantly high among persons in their 40s to 60s, healthcare professionals and those with a high degree of pain. Moreover, L score scarcely changed between before and after surgery when compared with E score and N score. Conclusion: L score is not greatly influenced by an individual's state of mind or situation at different times, and may indicate the personality traits proper to the person. It is shown that L score may indicate the personality trait characteristics of persons who want to make themselves look good in the eyes of other.",0.39915966386554624

The results indicated the following: (a) in older adults, response type and auditory stimuli strongly affected motor inhibition failure, and (b) in younger adults, motor inhibition failures rarely occurred. When they did occur, they were strongly affected by factors directing visual stimuli. These results suggest age-related differences in variables that affect motor inhibition, and that movement and the associated nervous excitation might strongly affect motor inhibition in older adults. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

Is Perceived Creativity-Reward Contingency Good for Creativity? The Role of Challenge and Threat Appraisals,2017,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992735208&doi=10.1002%2fhrm.21795&partnerID=40&md5=9179126babf74f53e08547648ff33550,"To address the complex effect of perceived reward for creativity on creative performance, we examined the role of cognitive appraisal as an individual difference variable. An individual's appraisal of reward for creativity, including challenge appraisal (perceived potential for recognition, growth, or mastery) and threat appraisal (perceived potential for revealing incompetence and damaging self-respect), is hypothesized to shape the effects of perceived reward for creativity. We further expect creativity-related intrinsic motivation to play a mediating role in the perceived reward-creativity relationship. The results of a three-wave field study showed that when challenge appraisal was high, perceived reward was positively related to creative performance through creativity-related intrinsic motivation, whereas when threat appraisal was high, perceived reward was negatively related to creative performance through creativity-related intrinsic motivation. A similar analysis showed that intrinsic task motivation was not able to channel the moderating effect of perceived reward and individual appraisal on creative performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.6

Participants were 238 Japanese undergraduates who read a scenario describing a social predicament and assessed excuse values in terms of their cognitive and behavioral reactions elicited by the excuse-maker. The results showed that insisting on depression was evaluated as a valid excuse, as were physical illness and work requirements, albeit there was no description of any obstacle to the excuse-maker’s progress including depressive symptoms. When these three statements were used as excuses, the participants were more likely to consider the target favorably and were motivated to behave more generously towards him than when he made no excuse or said, “I forgot” (i.e., negligence).

This study examines the hypothesis that culture and social status moderate this tendency, as well as the alternative hypothesis that social status and culture influence delay discounting independently of each other. American and Japanese adults were asked to choose receiving hypothetical monetary rewards either immediately or receiving rewards of different amounts with a delay of 1 year. The results replicated previous findings and supported the alternative hypothesis. Delay discounting was lower when subjective socioeconomic status (i.e., an individual’s perception of her or his social rank) was higher. Also, the Japanese were less likely to discount future rewards than the Americans. However, there was no interaction between social status and culture in influencing the rates of delay discounting. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

Perception and representation of lexical tones in native Mandarin-learning infants and toddlers,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025449254&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01117&partnerID=40&md5=b4b55bc70457ce5d90098fc605153e21,"We investigated the perceptual development of lexical tones in native tone-learning infants during the first 2 years of life, focusing on two important stages of phonological acquisition: the preverbal and vocabulary explosion stages. Experiment 1 examined monolingual Mandarin-Chinese-learning 4- to 13-month-olds' discrimination of similar lexical tones in Mandarin, Tone 2 (T2, rising) vs. Tone 3 (T3, low-dipping). Infants were habituated to exemplars of one tone (either T2 or T3), and tested with new exemplars of the habituated tone vs. the contrasting tone. Results show that looking time increased for the contrasting tone, but not for new exemplars of the habituated tone, suggesting that infants discriminated the two tones as separate categories. Furthermore, infants' discrimination of the tones was comparable across ages. Experiment 2 tested whether tones are distinguished in toddlers' lexicon. Monolingual Mandarin-learning 19- to 26-month-olds were presented with pairs of objects while one was named. Targets were familiar words bearing T2 or T3, either correctly pronounced (CP) or mispronounced (MP) in tone. We found that word recognition was equally successful in CP and in MP trials when T2 was mispronounced as T3 and T3 as T2, indicating that T2 and T3 are confusable. In contrast, recognition failed when T2 and T3 words were mispronounced as Tone 4 (T4, falling), showing that T4 was represented as a distinct category. Results show that toddlers have difficulty encoding similar tones distinctly in known words. The T2-T3 contrast is particularly challenging because of Tone 3 Sandhi, which changes T3 to T2 when it precedes another T3. At the stage when toddlers track the meaning of T2 and T3 words and track the sandhi alternations, they seem to overgeneralize the two tones as variants of one functional category, reflecting perceptual organization at the level of phonemic learning. © 2017 Shi, Gao, Achim and Li.",0.4013840830449827

One is mind-reading, in which an internal state such as an intention or an emotional state is assumed to be a source of a variety of behaviors. The other is behavior-reading, in which an actor's behavior is modeled based on stimulus-response associations without assuming internal states behind the behavior. We hypothesize that anthropomorphic features are key for an observer switching between these two cognitive strategies in a competitive situation. We provide support for this hypothesis through two studies using four agents with different appearances. We show that only a human agent was thought to possess both the ability to generate a variety of behaviors and internal mental states, such as minds and emotions (Study 1). We also show that humans used mixed (opposing) strategies against a human agent and exploitative strategies against the agents with mechanical appearances when they played a repeated zero-sum game (Study 2). Our findings show that humans understand that human behavior is varied; that humans have internal states, such as minds and emotions; that the behavior of machines is governed by a limited number of fixed rules; and that machines do not possess internal mental states. Our findings also suggest that the function of mind-reading is to trigger a strategy for use against agents with variable behavior and that humans exploit others who lack behavioral variability based on behavior-reading in a competitive situation. © 2017 Terada and Yamada.",0.3925619834710744

In addition, multi-group analyses of gender showed no gender differences between social support and PTG in the cross-lagged model.

Bilateral reflex fluctuations during rhythmic movement of remote limb pairs,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027884295&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00355&partnerID=40&md5=3c8fe51a09c7ab01c2aaaacec0f1d8c3,"The modulation of spinal cord excitability during rhythmic limb movement reflects the neuronal coordination underlying actions of the arms and legs. Integration of network activity in the spinal cord can be assessed by reflex variability between the limbs, an approach so far very little studied. The present work addresses this question by eliciting Hoffmann (H-) reflexes in both limbs to assess if common drive onto bilateral pools of motoneurons influence spinal cord excitability simultaneously or with a delay between sides. A cross-covariance (CCV) sequence between reflexes in both arms or legs was evaluated under conditions providing common drive bilaterally through voluntary muscle contraction and/or rhythmic movement of the remote limbs. For H-reflexes in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle, either contraction of the FCR or leg cycling induced significant reduction in the amplitude of the peak at the zero lag in the CCV sequence, indicating independent variations in spinal excitability between both sides. In contrast, for H-reflexes in the soleus (SO) muscle, arm cycling revealed no reduction in the amplitude of the peak in the CCV sequence at the zero lag. This suggests a more independent control of the arms compared with the legs. These results provide new insights into the organization of human limb control in rhythmic activity and the behavior of bilateral reflex fluctuations under different motor tasks. From a functional standpoint, changes in the co-variability might reflect dynamic adjustments in reflex excitability that are subsumed under more global control features during locomotion. © 2017 Mezzarane, Nakajima and Zehr.",0.46987951807228917

Here we provided direct evidence demonstrating that daily experience with the cardinal coordinate system (i.e., east, west, north, and south) contributed to the representation of cognitive maps. Behaviorally, we found that individuals who relied more on the cardinal coordinate system for daily navigation made smaller errors in an indoor pointing task, suggesting that the cardinal coordinate system is an important element of cognitive maps. Neurally, the extent to which individuals relied on the cardinal coordinate system was positively correlated with the gray matter volume of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting that the entorhinal cortex may serve as the neuroanatomical basis of coordinate-based navigation (the entorhinal coordinate area, ECA). Further analyses on the resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the intrinsic interaction between the ECA and two hippocampal sub-regions, the subiculum and cornu ammonis, might be linked with the representation precision of cognitive maps. In sum, our study reveals an association between daily experience with the cardinal coordinate system and cognitive maps, and suggests that the ECA works in collaboration with hippocampal sub-regions to represent cognitive maps. © 2017 Hao, Huang, Song, Kong and Liu.",0.44878048780487806
Lost in distractors: Reduced Autobiographical Memory Specificity and dispersed activation spreading over distractors in working memory,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018475547&doi=10.1016%2fj.brat.2017.04.005&partnerID=40&md5=da755d86dd5a2e967df96111718a68bc,"Studies on autobiographical memory retrieval highlight the prominence of rapid and direct access to a specific event memory. Because it has been believed that autobiographical memory retrieval mostly relies on an effortful generative process, there is little empirical evidence on the early stage of information processing that contributes to autobiographical memory specificity (AMS). Therefore, we investigated the associations between AMS and automatic activation of information stimulated by rapid presentation of emotional words. Study 1 involved a visual search task to assess activation of various distractors in working memory. Participants with reduced AMS showed a tendency to activate distractors that were not semantically associated with preceding cues. In Study 2, we manipulated the levels of AMS by using a computerized version of Memory Specificity Training (c-MeST) to observe the changes in the activation of distractors. Results showed that increases in AMS were associated with decreases in activation of cue-unassociated distractors. These findings suggest that reduced AMS can be characterized by dispersed activation spreading over semantically unassociated distractors in automatic information selection of working memory. Because we also found an association between depressive symptoms and AMS, the role of automatic information processing in the relation between reduced AMS and depression is discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.4

Methods Researchers in the field of OCD were invited to contribute summary statistics on current and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders and suicidality in their patients with OCD. Results Data from 3711 adult patients with primary OCD came from Brazil (n = 955), India (n = 802), Italy (n = 750), South Africa (n = 565), Japan (n = 322), Australia (n = 219), and Spain (n = 98). The most common current comorbid disorders were major depressive disorder (28.4%; n = 1055), obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (24.5%, n = 478), generalized anxiety disorder (19.3%, n = 716), specific phobia (19.2%, n = 714) and social phobia (18.5%, n = 686). Major depression was also the most commonly co-occurring lifetime diagnosis, with a rate of 50.5% (n = 1874). OCD generally had an age of onset in late adolescence (mean = 17.9 years, SD = 1.9). Social phobia, specific phobia and body dysmorphic disorder also had an early age of onset. Co-occurring major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and psychotic disorders tended to have a later age of onset than OCD. Suicidal ideation within the last month was reported by 6.4% (n = 200) of patients with OCD and 9.0% (n = 314) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt. Conclusions In this large cross-continental study, comorbidity in OCD was common. The high rates of comorbid major depression and anxiety disorders emphasize the need for clinicians to assess and monitor for these disorders. Earlier ages of onset of OCD, specific phobia and social phobia may indicate some relatedness between these disorders, but this requires further study. Although there do not appear to be significant cultural variations in rates or patterns of comorbidity and suicidality, further research using similar recruitment strategies and controlling for demographic and clinical variables may help to determine whether any sociocultural factors protect against suicidal ideation or psychiatric comorbidity in patients with OCD. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.42151162790697677

Identifying people at risk of postpartum depression may improve its management. The objective of this study was to determine the probable association between postpartum depression and some preconception gynecological morbidities. Methods Data from a nationwide birth cohort study, the Japan Environment and Children's study (JECS), up to one month of postpartum were analyzed. To assess postpartum depression, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used; 11 preconception gynecological morbidities were considered as risk factors. Covariates included psychiatric illness history, psychosocial factors, some pregnancy adverse outcomes, birth outcomes, socio-demographic and health behavioral factors. Results Except for the prevalence of previous miscarriage, leiomyoma and polycystic ovarian syndrome, depressive women had more gynecological morbidities compared to non-depressive ones. In logistic regression model, endometriosis (OR, 1.27; 95%CI: 1.15–1.41), dysmenorrhea (OR, 1.13; 95%CI: 1.06–1.21) and abnormal uterine bleeding (OR, 1.21; 95%CI: 1.15–1.29) were associated with postpartum depression. Limitations • We could not specify in detail which type of gynecological morbidity was associated with postpartum depression, because the current design was not exclusively oriented by the JECS research question.• A part of gynecological morbidities were self-reported.Conclusion Women with endometriosis and menstrual problems were at risk of developing postpartum depression.

Trait anxiety impacts the perceived gaze direction of fearful but not angry faces,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023188258&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01186&partnerID=40&md5=b9a62492698e0e52fb37bccca7dd0895,"Facial expression and gaze direction play an important role in social communication. Previous research has demonstrated the perception of anger is enhanced by direct gaze, whereas, it is unclear whether perception of fear is enhanced by averted gaze. In addition, previous research has shown the anxiety affects the processing of facial expression and gaze direction, but hasn't measured or controlled for depression. As a result, firm conclusions cannot be made regarding the impact of individual differences in anxiety and depression on perceptions of face expressions and gaze direction. The current study attempted to reexamine the effect of the anxiety level on the processing of facial expressions and gaze direction by matching participants on depression scores. A reliable psychophysical index of the range of eye gaze angles judged as being directed at oneself [the cone of direct gaze (CoDG)] was used as the dependent variable in this study. Participants were stratified into high/low trait anxiety groups and asked to judge the gaze of angry, fearful, and neutral faces across a range of gaze directions. The result showed: (1) the perception of gaze direction was influenced by facial expression and this was modulated by trait anxiety. For the high trait anxiety group, the CoDG for angry expressions was wider than for fearful and neutral expressions, and no significant difference emerged between fearful and neutral expressions; For the low trait anxiety group, the CoDG for both angry and fearful expressions was wider than for neutral, and no significant difference emerged between angry and fearful expressions. (2) Trait anxiety modulated the perception of gaze direction only in the fearful condition, such that the fearful CoDG for the high trait anxiety group was narrower than the low trait anxiety group. This demonstrated that anxiety distinctly affected gaze perception in expressions that convey threat (angry, fearful), such that a high trait anxiety level modulated the impact of indirectly threatening expressions (fearful), and did not influence responses to directly threatening expression (angry). These findings partially support the shared signal hypothesis. © 2017 Hu, Gendron, Liu, Zhao and Li.",0.5133531157270029

On the basis of the person-artifact-task model, we selected computer games (tasks) with varying levels of difficulty (difficult, medium, and easy) and shyness (personality) as flow precursors to study the physiological activity of users in a flow state. Cardiac and respiratory activity and mean changes in skin conductance (SC) were measured continuously while the participants (n = 40) played the games. Moreover, the associations between self-reported psychological flow and physiological measures were investigated through a series of repeated-measures analyses. The results showed that the flow experience is related to a faster respiratory rate, deeper respiration, moderate heart rate (HR), moderate HR variability, and moderate SC. The main effect of shyness was non-significant, whereas the interaction of shyness and difficulty influenced the flow experience. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of arousal and valence. The results indicate that the flow state is a state of moderate mental effort that arises through the increased parasympathetic modulation of sympathetic activity. © 2017 Tian, Bian, Han, Wang, Gao and Chen.",0.4842105263157895

We previously reported that ATF5-deficient (ATF5−/−) mice demonstrated abnormal olfactory bulb development due to impaired interneuron supply. Furthermore, ATF5−/− mice were less aggressive than ATF5+/+ mice. Although ATF5 is widely expressed in the brain, and involved in the regulation of proliferation and development of neurons, the physiological role of ATF5 in the higher brain remains unknown. Our objective was to investigate the physiological role of ATF5 in the higher brain. We performed a comprehensive behavioral analysis using ATF5−/− mice and wild type littermates. ATF5−/− mice exhibited abnormal locomotor activity in the open field test. They also exhibited abnormal anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark transition test and open field test. Furthermore, ATF5−/− mice displayed reduced social interaction in the Crawley’s social interaction test and increased pain sensitivity in the hot plate test compared with wild type. Finally, behavioral flexibility was reduced in the T-maze test in ATF5−/− mice compared with wild type. In addition, we demonstrated that ATF5−/− mice display disturbances of monoamine neurotransmitter levels in several brain regions. These results indicate that ATF5 deficiency elicits abnormal behaviors and the disturbance of monoamine neurotransmitter levels in the brain. The behavioral abnormalities of ATF5−/− mice may be due to the disturbance of monoamine levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that ATF5−/− mice may be a unique animal model of some psychiatric disorders. © 2017 Umemura, Ogura, Matsuzaki, Nakano, Takao, Miyakawa and Takahashi.",0.3673469387755102
Altered brain activities associated with craving and cue reactivity in people with Internet gaming disorder: Evidence from the comparison with recreational Internet game users,2017,42,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85022336979&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01150&partnerID=40&md5=1d15e939dfa2e9be01e49feee22f850a,"Although the neural substrates of cue reactivity in Internet gaming disorder (IGD) have been examined in previous studies, most of these studies focused on the comparison between IGD subjects and healthy controls, which cannot exclude a potential effect of cue-familiarity. To overcome this limitation, the current study focuses on the comparison between IGD subjects and recreational Internet game users (RGU) who play online games recreationally but do not develop dependence. Data from 40 RGU and 30 IGD subjects were collected while they were performing an event-related cue reactivity task in the fMRI scanner. The results showed that the IGD subjects were associated with enhanced activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and decreased activation in the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right precuneus, left precentral gyrus and right postcentral gyrus in comparison with the RGU subjects. OFC is involved in reward evaluation and ACC is implicated in executive control function based on previous researches. Moreover, the activation of OFC were correlated with the desire for game-playing. Thus, the higher activation in OFC might suggests high desire for game playing, and the lower activation in ACC might indicates impaired ability in inhibiting the urge to gaming-related stimuli in IGD subjects. Additionally, decreased activation in the precuneus, the precentral and postcentral gyrus may suggest the deficit in disentangling from game-playing stimuli. These findings explain why IGD subjects develop dependence on game-playing while RGU subjects can play online games recreationally and prevent the transition from voluntary game-playing to eventually IGD. © 2017 Wang, Wu, Wang, Li, Liu, Du and Dong.",0.35177865612648224
Meaning in life in psychotherapy: The perspective of experienced psychotherapists,2017,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947257345&doi=10.1080%2f10503307.2015.1110636&partnerID=40&md5=c86628fc5a9bddfafeaf7f0d077c27bf,"Objective: Our goal was to explore the meaning experienced psychotherapists derive from providing psychotherapy, their beliefs about the role of meaning in life (MIL) in psychotherapy, how they worked with MIL with a client who explicitly presented concerns about MIL, and how they worked with a different client for whom MIL was a secondary and more implicit concern. Method: Thirteen experienced psychotherapists were interviewed and data were analyzed using consensual qualitative research. Results: Therapists derived self-oriented meaning (e.g., feeling gratified, fulfilled, connected) and other-oriented meaning (helping others, making the world a better place) from providing psychotherapy. They believed that MIL is fundamental and underlies all human concerns, including those brought to therapy. In contrast to the clients who had implicit MIL concerns, clients who explicitly presented MIL concerns were reported to have more interpersonal problems and physical problems, but about the same amount of psychological distress and loss/grief. Therapists used insight-oriented interventions, support, action-oriented interventions, and exploratory interventions to work with MIL with both types of clients, but used more exploratory interventions with implicit than explicit MIL clients. Conclusions: MIL is a salient topic for experienced, existentially oriented psychotherapists; they work with MIL extensively with some clients in psychotherapy. We recommend that therapists receive training to work with MIL in therapy, and that they pay attention to MIL concerns when they conduct psychotherapy. We also recommend additional research on MIL in psychotherapy. © 2015 Society for Psychotherapy Research.",0.4067796610169492
Differences in inhibitory control between impulsive and premeditated aggression in juvenile inmates,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027849577&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00373&partnerID=40&md5=2efef141516e8b48c9bb826830e44fac,"Inhibitory control dysfunction was considered a universal characteristic of violent offenders. The aim of this study was to examine differences in inhibitory control between two subtypes of violent youth; those displaying predominantly impulsive and those presenting predominantly premeditated aggression (PM). Forty-four juvenile offenders, defined on the basis of the Procedures for the Classification of Aggressive/Violent Acts (Stanford and Barratt, 2001) participated (N = 23: impulsive; N = 21 premeditated). A visual Go/NoGo task was used to compare behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) between groups. The task contained two letters (W and M), W was the Go stimulus and M the NoGo stimulus. The impulsive youth showed a significantly greater decrease in N2 latency for Go relative to NoGo trials than the premeditated aggressive youth. The differentiation in N2 amplitude between Go and NoGo (N2d) was negatively correlated with impulsivity of aggression. Both groups showed no significant central NoGo P3. Our findings suggest that impulsive violent youth show stronger prepotent responses and impaired conflict monitoring during early inhibitory control processing relative to premeditated aggressive youth. Both impulsive and premeditated violent youth may show impaired response inhibition at the late processing stage of inhibitory control. © 2017 Zhang, Wang, Liu, Song and Yang.",0.4717948717948718

Studies found thatmoral threat initiates the need of physical cleanliness, but actual physical cleaning and priming of cleaning have inconsistent effects on subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Here, we used resting-state functionalmagnetic resonance imaging to explore the underlying neuralmechanismof actual physical cleaning and priming of cleaning. After recallingmoral transgression with strong feelings of guilt and shame, participants either actually cleaned their faces with a wipe or were primed with cleanliness through viewing its pictures. Results showed that actual physical cleaning reduced the spontaneous brain activities in the right insula and MPFC, regions that involved in embodiedmoral emotion processing, while priming of cleaning decreased activities in the right superior frontal gyrus andmiddle frontal gyrus, regions that participated in executive control processing. Additionally, actual physical cleaning also changed functional connectivity between insula/MPFC and emotion related regions, whereas priming of cleaningmodified connectivity within bothmoral and sensorimotor areas. These findings revealed that actual physical cleaning and priming of cleaning led to changes in different brain regions and networks, providing neural evidence for the inconsistent effects of cleanliness on subsequent attitudes and behaviors. © The Author (2017).

In Study 1, I replicated Liszkowski et al., (2012) study, wherein infants and caregivers engaged in 5-min interactions in a decorated room. In Study 2, younger infants and their caregivers who participated in Study 1 were observed about 7 months later in a similar decorated room as in Study 1. Both studies showed that caregivers produced index-finger pointing more frequently than did younger infants, whereas older infants’ index-finger pointing was comparable to caregivers’. Study 2 demonstrated that caregivers’ contingent pointing—namely, index-finger pointing less than 6 s after young infants’ pointing—led to an increase in infants’ frequency of index-finger pointing 7 months later. These results suggested that caregivers’ contingent pointing has the function of promoting active production of index-finger pointing by infants. © 2017 The Author",0.4264705882352941

Studies 1 and 2 examined how different measures as proxies for life history strategy (i.e., Mini-K and High-K Strategy Scale) relate to cooperation in various economic games. Studies 3 to 5 measured early childhood environments (i.e., childhood harshness and unpredictability), manipulated resource scarcity using previously validated methods, and then measured cooperation. Across our studies, we also examined four hypothesized psychological mechanisms that could explain the relation between life history strategy and cooperation: temporal discounting, concern for reputation, social value orientation, and trust in others. Overall, we found no support for the hypothesis that life history strategy predicts cooperation or that early childhood environments interact with current resource scarcity to predict cooperation. Thus, our initial findings imply that life history theory may not account for individual variation in cooperation with unknown others. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.47023809523809523
Preference for averageness in faces does not generalize to non-human primates,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027833099&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00129&partnerID=40&md5=7d28409917da2f6fee4019a94c0c6547,"Facial attractiveness is a long-standing topic of active study in both neuroscience and social science, motivated by its positive social consequences. Over the past few decades, it has been established that averageness is a major factor influencing judgments of facial attractiveness in humans. Non-human primates share similar social behaviors as well as neural mechanisms related to face processing with humans. However, it is unknown whether monkeys, like humans, also find particular faces attractive and, if so, which kind of facial traits they prefer. To address these questions, we investigated the effect of averageness on preferences for faces in monkeys. We tested three adult male rhesus macaques using a visual paired comparison (VPC) task, in which they viewed pairs of faces (both individual faces, or one individual face and one average face); viewing time was used as a measure of preference. We did find that monkeys looked longer at certain individual faces than others. However, unlike humans, monkeys did not prefer the average face over individual faces. In fact, the more the individual face differed from the average face, the longer the monkeys looked at it, indicating that the average face likely plays a role in face recognition rather than in judgments of facial attractiveness: in models of face recognition, the average face operates as the norm against which individual faces are compared and recognized. Taken together, our study suggests that the preference for averageness in faces does not generalize to non-human primates. © 2017 Tomeo, Ungerleider and Liu.",0.5487804878048781

Eighty-four college students were randomly assigned to three groups. Virtual reality drama is used to train teachers concerning school bullying prevention, and deals with the dialogue between teachers and students. Group 1 was provided with full-shot video clips, Group 2 was shown various clips from full shots to extreme close-ups, and Group 3 was provided with close-up shots. We found that the virtual reality drama viewers’ levels of stimulation changed in relation to the size of the shots.

Government issues safe bonds and levies taxes to finance public expenditures, while the Central Bank follows a feedback Taylor rules by pegging the nominal interest rate. We show that when the nominal interest rate is bound to be non-negative, under active policy rules a Liquidity Trap steady state does emerge besides the Leeper (1991) equilibrium. The stability of the two steady states depends, in turn, upon the amplitude of the liquidity constraint. When the share of consumption to be paid cash is set lower than one half, the Liquidity Trap equilibrium is indeterminate. The stability of the Leeper equilibrium too depends dramatically upon the amplitude of the liquidity constraint: for low amplitudes of the latter, the Leeper equilibrium can be indeed stable. Policy and Taylor rules are thus theoretically rehabilitated since their targets, by contrast with a vast literature, may be reached for infinitely many agents’ beliefs. We also show that a relaxation of the liquidity constraint is Pareto-improving and that the Liquidity Trap equilibrium Pareto-dominates the Leeper one, in view of the zero cost of money. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.4263157894736842

However, it is not clear what happens to stored information in the face of unexpected tasks, such as the surprise questions that are often used in experiments related to inattentional and change blindness. Does the unpredicted shift in task context cause memory representations to be cleared in anticipation of new information? To answer this question, we ran two experiments where the task unexpectedly switched partway through the experiment with a surprise question. Half of the participants were asked to report the same attribute (Exp. 1 = Identity, Exp. 2 = Color) of a target stimulus in both presurprise and postsurprise trials, while for the other half, the reported attribute switched from identity to color (Exp. 1) or vice versa (Exp. 2). Importantly, all participants had to read an unexpected set of instructions and respond differently on the surprise trial. Accuracy on the surprise trial was higher for the same-attribute groups than the different-attribute groups. Furthermore, there was no difference in reaction time on the surprise trial between the two groups. These results suggest that information participants expected to report can survive an encounter with an unexpected task. The implication is that failures to report information on a surprise trial in many experiments reflect genuine differences in memory encoding, rather than forgetting or overwriting induced by the surprise question. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.40408163265306124

Likewise, significant correlations were found between the semantic variables. Importantly, we explored the relationships between ratings for the affective variables (i.e., valence and arousal) and concreteness ratings, suggesting that valence and arousal ratings can predict concreteness ratings.

Here, we report that the perceived duration for slow moving stimuli can be shorter than for static stimuli under specific circumstances. Observers were tested using natural movies presented at various speeds (0.0× = static, 0.25× = slow, or 1.9× = fast, relative to original speed) and indicated whether test duration was perceived as longer or shorter than comparison movies presented at their original speed. While fast movies were perceived as longer than slow and static movies (in accordance with previous studies), we found that slow movies were perceived as shorter (i.e., time compressed) compared to static images. Similar results were obtained for artificial stimuli consisting of drifting gratings. However, time compression for slow stimuli disappeared if comparison stimuli were replaced by a white static disk that removed repetitive exposures to moving stimuli. Results suggest that duration estimation is modulated by contextual effects induced by the specific diet - or distribution - of prior visual stimuli to which observers are exposed. A simple model, which includes a rapid recalibration of human time estimation via adaptation to preceding stimuli, succeeds in reproducing our experimental data. © 2017 Kashiwakura and Motoyoshi.",0.5025641025641026

Despite our intuitive understanding that time is robustly estimated in any situation, tactile sub-second time is altered by, for example, body movement, similar to how visual time is modulated by eye movement. The effects of simpler factors, such as stimulus location, intensity, and frequency, have also been reported in temporal tasks in other modalities, but their effects on tactile sub-second interval estimation remain obscure. Here, we were interested in whether a perceived short interval presented by tactile stimuli is altered only by changing stimulus features. The perceived interval between a pair of stimuli presented on the same finger apparently became short relative to that on different fingers; that of a weak-intensity pair relative to that of a pair with stronger intensity was decreased; and that of a pair with the same frequency relative to one with different frequencies was underestimated. These findings can be ascribed to errors in encoding temporal relationships: nearby-space/weak-intensity/similar-frequency stimuli presented within a short time difference are likely to be integrated into a single event and lead to relative time compression. © 2017 Kuroki, Yokosaka and Watanabe.",0.4642857142857143

Structural equation modeling was used to test the mediation hypothesis. The analysis indicated that both collective and personal self-esteem partially mediated the relationship between perceived discrimination and subjective well-being. The final model also revealed a significant path from perceived discrimination through collective and personal self-esteem to subjective well-being. These findings contribute to the understanding of the complicated relationships among perceived discrimination, collective and personal self-esteem, and subjective well-being. The findings suggest that collective and personal self-esteem are possible targets for interventions aimed at improving subjective well-being.

Although this impairment is central to their social malfunctioning, its structural neural correlates remain unclear. To investigate this issue, we assessed Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, revised version (Eyes Test) and acquired structural magnetic resonance images in adults with high-functioning ASD (n = 19) and age-, sex- and intelligence quotient-matched typically developing (TD) controls (n = 19). On the behavioral level, the Eyes Test scores were lower in the ASD group than in the control group. On the neural level, an interaction between group and Eyes Test score was found in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). A positive association between the Eyes Test score and gray matter volume of this region was evident in the control group, but not in the ASD group. This finding suggests that the failure to develop appropriate structural neural representations in the TPJ may underlie the impaired ability of individuals with ASD to read the mind in the eyes. These behavioral and neural findings provide support for the theories that impairments in processing eyes and the ability to infer others’ mental states are the core symptoms of ASD, and that atypical features in the social brain network underlie such impairments. © 2017 Sato, Uono, Kochiyama, Yoshimura, Sawada, Kubota, Sakihama and Toichi.",0.38565022421524664
Rethinking the relationship between pronoun-drop and individualism with Bayesian multilevel models,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054718408&doi=10.1093%2fjole%2flzx003&partnerID=40&md5=1d83e3244cb45ebba7e3c3901d72c7cb,"Can the language we speak determine how we represent the world around us? To those familiar with the theory of linguistic relativity, this may seem like an age-old question about which everyone has their own answer. Although the evidence supporting linguistic relativity remains controversial, the long reach of language into our perception and behavior is nevertheless an intriguing possibility that deserves further investigation. Here I take a closer look at a case of linguistic relativity that had a particularly strong impact on cross-cultural research: the pronoun-drop effect. The theory of pronoun-drop effect posits that languages that allow their speakers to drop subject pronouns in verbal communication would lead their speakers to create collectivistic culture. It was argued that the absence of pronouns necessitates the speakers to embed their self-identities in the context of social interaction, so the linguistic practice of omitting pronouns would reduce the sense of individuality in the minds of speakers. After conducting a series of Bayesian multilevel analyses on the original dataset, however, the current study concludes that the pronoun-drop effect is unlikely to be a robust, universal phenomenon. The analyses revealed that the majority of statistical signal supporting the phenomenon comes from the Indo-European language family, and other families provided little or inconsistent evidence. It was also observed that the Indo-European languages alone made up 61 per cent of the original dataset, and dropping them from analysis completely nullified the pronoun-drop effect. These observations suggest that the pronoun-drop effect is a consequence of failing to account for (i) varying effects among language families and (ii) overrepresentation of the Indo-European languages. With these results, this article suggests that the theory of pronoun-drop effect should be thoroughly revised. Additionally, the article provides several suggestions for many similar cross-cultural studies that suffer from the same problems as the pronoun-drop effect study. © The Author 2017.

Unbounded indirect reciprocity: Is reputation-based cooperation bounded by group membership?,2017,37,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014848369&doi=10.1016%2fj.jesp.2017.02.008&partnerID=40&md5=a31ba06faca0067ae46f04c6139d486a,"Bounded generalized reciprocity (BGR) predicts that people cooperate to maintain a positive reputation with ingroup, but not outgroup, members—and this explains ingroup favoritism in cooperation. We propose that the benefits of maintaining a positive reputation are not limited by group boundaries and so people may cooperate to maintain a good reputation among outgroup members when they will meet and interact with members of that group again. According to this unbounded indirect reciprocity perspective, reputation can promote cooperation with both ingroup and outgroup members. Alternatively, social identity theory (SIT) favors social identity versus reputation as an explanation for cooperation among ingroup members. We test these hypotheses across five studies (Ns = 619, 607, 613, 360, and 615) that manipulate reputation, social identification, and partner's group membership in a cooperative decision making task. Across our studies, people were more cooperative with both ingroup and outgroup members when their reputation was at stake (Studies 1–5), and reputational concern mediated the effect of cues of gossip on cooperation in interactions with ingroup and outgroup members (Studies 1–4). Social identification did not affect cooperation with ingroup members. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the indirect benefits of cooperation that can transcend group boundaries. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.4329896907216495
Prediction of mind-wandering with electroencephalogram and non-linear regression modeling,2017,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027888718&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00365&partnerID=40&md5=767c4c10d7b3691370050bd2385a4455,"Mind-wandering (MW), task-unrelated thought, has been examined by researchers in an increasing number of articles using models to predict whether subjects are in MW, using numerous physiological variables. However, these models are not applicable in general situations. Moreover, they output only binary classification. The current study suggests that the combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) variables and non-linear regression modeling can be a good indicator of MW intensity. We recorded EEGs of 50 subjects during the performance of a Sustained Attention to Response Task, including a thought sampling probe that inquired the focus of attention. We calculated the power and coherence value and prepared 35 patterns of variable combinations and applied Support Vector machine Regression (SVR) to them. Finally, we chose four SVR models: two of them non-linear models and the others linear models; two of the four models are composed of a limited number of electrodes to satisfy model usefulness. Examination using the held-out data indicated that all models had robust predictive precision and provided significantly better estimations than a linear regression model using single electrode EEG variables. Furthermore, in limited electrode condition, non-linear SVR model showed significantly better precision than linear SVR model. The method proposed in this study helps investigations into MW in various little-examined situations. Further, by measuring MW with a high temporal resolution EEG, unclear aspects of MW, such as time series variation, are expected to be revealed. Furthermore, our suggestion that a few electrodes can also predict MW contributes to the development of neuro-feedback studies. © 2017 Kawashima and Kumano.",0.452

Quality was measured by: (1) classroom observations using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R); (2) teacher characteristics; and (3) structural characteristics of preschools. Children’s development was measured using the Early Development Instrument (EDI). The article proposes two methodological improvements to preschool quality studies. First, an instrumental variable approach is used to correct for measurement error. Second, ECERS-R is adjusted to the local context by contrasting items with Indonesia’s national preschool standards. Results show that observed classroom quality is a significant and meaningful positive predictor of children’s development once models correct for measurement error and apply a locally-adapted measure of classroom quality. In contrast, teacher characteristics and structural characteristics are not significant predictors of child development, while holding observed classroom quality constant. © 2017 The World Bank.",0.4863013698630137
Diverse reports recommendation system based on latent Dirichlet allocation,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046655447&doi=10.1007%2fs41237-017-0027-7&partnerID=40&md5=12696a79279b79dc701639215d49e7dd,"This paper presents a proposal for system supporting learners in improving their report-writing skills by recommending reports from previous learners. The proposed system recommends reports that share similar subjects but which have different structures, expressions, and originality based on the distributions of words and subjects within the reports, as estimated using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). An important assumption made for this study is that reports with different word distributions tend to include different structures, expressions, and originality when they share similar subjects. Based on that assumption, the system selects and recommends reports that have dissimilar word distributions but which share similar subject distributions with a learner’s report. The proposed system is expected to enhance learning of various writing skills from other learners. Finally, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system through actual data experiments. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.5144927536231884

Different concepts and techniques exist in different research areas, and when the fields are sufficiently similar, a salient combination of two different areas can lead to the development of novel research. We have assumed that two different research areas, sharing a high number of similar keywords, would be excellent candidates for integration. We combined link mining and text mining techniques to elucidate hidden but implicit opportunities among apparent, explicit research clusters. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a case study on fuel cells and ammonia synthesis. Fuel cells are a rapidly growing research field, while ammonia synthesis is relatively mature. Our results successfully extracted a plausible and post-mature research idea. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.5234375
Expectation of a Decrease in Pain Affects the Prognosis of Pain in Cancer Patients: a Prospective Cohort Study of Response to Morphine,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014572724&doi=10.1007%2fs12529-017-9644-5&partnerID=40&md5=16009cc8237b26233907a8b2f65b149c,"Purpose: Cancer pain is a multidimensional experience that includes physiological, sensory, affective, cognitive, behavioral, and sociocultural dimensions. Few prospective studies have examined the relationship between a patient’s expectation of pain improvement and the pain prognosis. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether patients’ expectation to pain reduction was associated with pain intensity after morphine treatment in opioid treatment-naïve patients with various types of cancer. Methods: The subjects were patients scheduled for cancer pain treatment with morphine who were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs daily. Morphine treatment was performed according to the standard method, including titration (NCCN Guidelines™, Adult Cancer Pain). Simple regression analysis was performed between pain intensity numerical rating scale (NRS) (day 8) as the dependent variable, expectation of pain decrease NRS (day 1), tumor types, and the following covariates as independent variables: patients’ characteristics such as age, gender, PS (day 1), genotype of catechol-O-methyltransferase, total scores of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (day 1), and pain intensity NRS (day 1). Multiple regression analysis was performed using forced entry methods with pain intensity NRS (day 8) as the dependent variable, and expectation of pain decrease NRS (day 1) and the covariates as independent variables that had a p value <0.05 in the simple regression models. Results: A total of 100 patients with baseline data were included, and 97 patients (51% female) met the inclusion criteria. Patients with a high expectation of pain decrease NRS had a significantly lower pain intensity NRS (day 8) (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Non-pharmacological factors such as expectations for pain treatment could also be important factors to treat cancer pain, which might be associated with communication skills in physicians. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.4734848484848485
Resting-state fluctuations of EEG sensorimotor rhythm reflect BOLD activities in the pericentral areas: A simultaneous EEG-fMRI study,2017,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027871691&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00356&partnerID=40&md5=0caf2eee22e3cf106b76a1ffaa5693ba,"Blockade of the scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) is a well-known phenomenon following attempted or executed motor functions. Such a frequency-specific power attenuation of the SMR occurs in the alpha and beta frequency bands and is spatially registered at primary somatosensory and motor cortices. Here, we hypothesized that resting-state fluctuations of the SMR in the alpha and beta frequency bands also covary with resting-state sensorimotor cortical activity, without involving task-related neural dynamics. The present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural regions whose activities were correlated with the simultaneously recorded SMR power fluctuations. The SMR power fluctuations were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and correlated with blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals obtained from the entire brain. Our findings show that the alpha and beta power components of the SMR correlate with activities of the pericentral area. Furthermore, brain regions with correlations between BOLD signals and the alpha-band SMR fluctuations were located posterior to those with correlations between BOLD signals and the beta-band SMR. These results are consistent with those of event-related studies of SMR modulation induced by sensory input or motor output. Our findings may help to understand the role of the sensorimotor cortex activity in contributing to the amplitude modulation of SMR during the resting state. This knowledge may be applied to the diagnosis of pathological conditions in the pericentral areas or the refinement of brain–computer interfaces using SMR in the future. © 2017 Tsuchimoto, Shibusawa, Mizuguchi, Kato, Ebata, Liu, Hanakawa and Ushiba.",0.3467741935483871

The cost of conducting eye movement studies has decreased as a result of the recent release of low-cost commercial and open-source eye trackers. However, synchronizing visual stimulus presentation with eye movement recording is still difficult, particularly if the eye tracker does not come with a practical application programming interface. This paper introduces a Matlab/Octave toolbox named Sgttoolbox, which works in conjunction with the widely used experiment control library Psychtoolbox to control a cross-platform open-source eye tracker named SimpleGazeTracker, which is an eye-tracking application of GazeParser software. Hardware and software requirements for Sgttoolbox and its main functions are described. A test of temporal accuracy showed that eye movement sampling frequency was stable when stimulus presentation and recording were performed on a single PC, although better performance was obtained when presentation and recording were performed on separate PCs. Transferring the latest eye position from SimpleGazeTracker to Psychtoolbox script takes 2 to 4 ms on average, which causes a delay in drawing multiple visual stimuli when recording and stimulus presentation were performed on a single PC. When such a transfer delay is not importnat, Sgttoolbox would be a good choice for Psychtoolbox users who wish to conduct eye-tracking studies. © 2016, The Author(s).",0.4396135265700483

However, long-Term administration of antipsychotics can upregulate D 2 receptors and produce receptor supersensitivity manifested by behavioral supersensitivity to dopamine stimulation in animals, and movement disorders and supersensitivity psychosis (SP) in patients. Antipsychotic-induced SP was first described as the emergence of psychotic symptoms with tardive dyskinesia (TD) and a fall in prolactin levels following drug discontinuation. In the era of first-generation antipsychotics, 4 clinical features characterized drug-induced SP: rapid relapse after drug discontinuation/dose reduction/switch of antipsychotics, tolerance to previously observed therapeutic effects, co-occurring TD, and psychotic exacerbation by life stressors. We review 3 recent studies on the prevalence rates of SP, and the link to treatment resistance and psychotic relapse in the era of second-generation antipsychotics (risperidone, paliperidone, perospirone, and long-Acting injectable risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole). These studies show that the prevalence rates of SP remain high in schizophrenia (30%) and higher (70%) in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. We then present neurobehavioral findings on antipsychotic-induced supersensitivity to dopamine from animal studies. Next, we propose criteria for SP, which describe psychotic symptoms and co-occurring movement disorders more precisely. Detection of mild/borderline drug-induced movement disorders permits early recognition of overblockade of D 2 receptors, responsible for SP and TD. Finally, we describe 3 antipsychotic withdrawal syndromes, similar to those seen with other CNS drugs, and we propose approaches to treat, potentially prevent, or temporarily manage SP. © 2017 S.

Therefore, this study examined social cultural model and objectification theory as explanations for stature concerns in a sample of undergraduate men and women from a university in Henan, China. Given height is a salient physical attribute for Chinese adolescents and young adults, we extended past studies on objectification theory by adding separate measures for stature surveillance. Participants (231 men, 473 women) completed a questionnaire assaying measures of sociocultural model features (appearance pressure from mass media and close interpersonal networks, appearance social comparisons), objectified body consciousness (body surveillance, body shame, stature surveillance), and stature concerns. In multiple regression models for each gender, appearance pressure from the mass media and stature surveillance were robust predictors of stature concerns for both genders, independent of reported height. Body surveillance predicted stature concerns for women but not men. These findings contribute to the broader field of multicultural body image research and may help to account for specific culturally salient appearance concerns within samples of young Chinese women and men. © 2017 Sun.",0.5421052631578948

However, we know little about cognitive and neural processes driving decisions to evade or pay taxes. This study focuses on the impact of perceived tax authority and examines the mental chronometry mirrored in ERP data allowing a deeper understanding about why humans cooperate in tax systems. We experimentally manipulated coercive and legitimate authority and studied its impact on cooperation and underlying cognitive (experiment 1, 2) and neuronal (experiment 2) processes. Experiment 1 showed that in a condition of coercive authority, tax payments are lower, decisions are faster and participants report more rational reasoning and enforced compliance, however, less voluntary cooperation than in a condition of legitimate authority. Experiment 2 confirmed most results, but did not find a difference in payments or selfreported rational reasoning. Moreover, legitimate authority led to heightened cognitive control (expressed by increased MFN amplitudes) and disrupted attention processing (expressed by decreased P300 amplitudes) compared to coercive authority. To conclude, the neuronal data surprisingly revealed that legitimate authority may led to higher decision conflict and thus to higher cognitive demands in tax decisions than coercive authority. © The Author (2017).

The relationship between music and brain such as cortical entrainment to periodic tune, periodic beat, and music have been well investigated. It has also been reported that the cerebral cortex responded more strongly to the periodic rhythm of unfamiliar music than to that of familiar music. However, previous works mainly used simple and artificial auditory stimuli like pure tone or beep. It is still unclear how the brain response is influenced by the familiarity of music. To address this issue, we analyzed electroencelphalogram(EEG) to investigate the relationship between cortical response and familiarity of music using melodies produced by piano sounds as simple natural stimuli. The cross-correlation function averaged across trials, channels, and participants showed two pronounced peaks at time lags around 70 and 140 ms. At the two peaks the magnitude of the cross-correlation values were significantly larger when listening to unfamiliar and scrambled music compared to those when listening to familiar music. Our findings suggest that the response to unfamiliar music is stronger than that to familiar music. One potential application of our findings would be the discrimination of listeners’ familiarity with music, which provides an important tool for assessment of brain activity. © 2017 Kumagai, Arvaneh and Tanaka.",0.48514851485148514

Furthermore, the indices of anticipatory adjustment of elemental variables (i.e., finger forces) prior to a quick pulse force production were quantified. It is currently unknown whether the organization and anticipatory modulation of stability properties are affected by force directions and strengths of in multi-finger actions. We expected to observe a smaller finger independency and larger indices of multi-finger coordination during extension than during flexion due to both neural and peripheral differences between the finger flexion and extension actions. We also examined the indices of the anticipatory adjustment between different force direction conditions. The anticipatory adjustment could be a neural process, which may be affected by the properties of the muscles and by the direction of the motions. The maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force was larger for flexion than for extension, which confirmed the fact that the strength of finger flexor muscles (e.g., flexor digitorum profundus) was larger than that of finger extensor (e.g., extensor digitorum). The analysis within the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis was used to quantify the motor synergy of elemental variables by decomposing two sources of variances across repetitive trials, which identifies the variances in the uncontrolled manifold (VUCM) and that are orthogonal to the UCM (VORT). The presence of motor synergy and its strength were quantified by the relative amount of VUCM and VORT. The strength of motor synergies at the steady state was larger in the extension condition, which suggests that the stability property (i.e., multi-finger synergies) may be a direction specific quantity. However, the results for the existence of anticipatory adjustment; however, no difference between the directional conditions suggests that feed-forward synergy adjustment (changes in the stability property) may be at least independent of the magnitude of the task-specific apparent performance variables and its direction (e.g., flexion and extension forces). © 2017 Park and Xu.",0.4146341463414634

To make better decisions, people need to evaluate others’ trustworthiness. They often assess this kind of reputation by learning through repeated social interactions. The present event-related potential (ERP) study explored the reputation learning process in a repeated trust game where subjects made multi-round decisions of investment to different partners. We found that subjects gradually learned to discriminate trustworthy partners from untrustworthy ones based on how often their partners reciprocated the investment, which was indicated by their own investment decisions. Besides, electrophysiological data showed that the faces of the untrustworthy partners induced larger feedback negativity (FN) amplitude than those of the trustworthy partners, but only in the late phase of the game. The ERP results corresponded with the behavioral pattern and revealed that the learned trustworthiness differentiation was coded by the cue-elicited FN component. Consistent with previous research, our findings suggest that the anterior cue-elicited FN reflects the reputation appraisal and tracks the reputation learning process in social interactions. © 2017 Li, Meng and Ma.",0.42196531791907516

We collected data from 185 dyads of subordinates and supervisors. Supervisors rated their own transformational leadership and subordinates’ adaptability, and subordinates rated their own job crafting and organizational identification. Results from structural equation modelling analyses partially supported our hypotheses. In general our findings suggest that transformational leadership is associated with more expansion job crafting (seeking resources and seeking challenges) via adaptability, particularly for employees with lower organizational identification. We conclude that transformational leadership is an important antecedent of employee adaptability and proactivity at work. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.48905109489051096

We alternated several periods of auditory pure-tone frequency discrimination (FD) with the popular spatial visual-motor game Tetris played in silence. Tetris play alone did not produce any auditory or cognitive benefits. However, when alternated with FD training it enhanced learning of FD and auditory working memory. The learning-enhancing effects of Tetris play cannot be explained simply by the visual-spatial training involved, as the effects were gone when Tetris play was replaced with another visual-spatial task using Tetris-like stimuli but not incorporated into a game environment. The results indicate that game play enhances learning and transfer of the contiguous auditory experiences, pointing to a promising approach for increasing the efficiency and applicability of rehabilitative training. © 2017 Zhang, Tang, Moore and Amitay.",0.40588235294117647

We investigated whether empathy for pain drives actions without altruistic effects and how such actions modulate neural responses to others' pain. In two experiments, we asked healthy adults to press a button for no reason when viewing video clips showing faces with pain expressions receiving needle penetration or faces with neutral expressions receiving a cotton swab touch. Experiment 1 found that participants pressed a button with greater response force when watching painful than non-painful stimuli. Participants who reported greater unpleasant feelings pressed the button harder when viewing painful stimuli. Experiment 2 revealed that passively viewing painful vs non-painful stimuli increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals in the middle cingulate cortex, supplementary motor cortex, and bilateral second somatosensory and inferior frontal cortex, which, however, were reduced by the action of button press without altruistic effects. In addition, individuals who reported higher personal distress illustrated greater decrease of the second somatosensory activity induced by button press. Our results indicate that empathy for pain motivates simple actions without altruistic effects that in turn reduce neural responses to others' pain, suggesting a functional role of action execution in self distress relief when viewing others' suffering. © The Author (2017).

"The effect of diaphragmatic breathing on attention, negative affect and stress in healthy adults",2017,198,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020403798&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00874&partnerID=40&md5=b02390e30c9dc6cff69fc7a79b341a37,"A growing number of empirical studies have revealed that diaphragmatic breathing may trigger body relaxation responses and benefit both physical and mental health. However, the specific benefits of diaphragmatic breathing on mental health remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of diaphragmatic breathing on cognition, affect, and cortisol responses to stress. Forty participants were randomly assigned to either a breathing intervention group (BIG) or a control group (CG). The BIG received intensive training for 20 sessions, implemented over 8 weeks, employing a real-time feedback device, and an average respiratory rate of 4 breaths/min, while the CG did not receive this treatment. All participants completed pre- and post-tests of sustained attention and affect. Additionally, pre-test and post-test salivary cortisol concentrations were determined in both groups. The findings suggested that the BIG showed a significant decrease in negative affect after intervention, compared to baseline. In the diaphragmatic breathing condition, there was a significant interaction effect of group by time on sustained attention, whereby the BIG showed significantly increased sustained attention after training, compared to baseline. There was a significant interaction effect of group and time in the diaphragmatic breathing condition on cortisol levels, whereby the BIG had a significantly lower cortisol level after training, while the CG showed no significant change in cortisol levels. In conclusion, diaphragmatic breathing could improve sustained attention, affect, and cortisol levels. This study provided evidence demonstrating the effect of diaphragmatic breathing, a mind-body practice, on mental function, from a health psychology approach, which has important implications for health promotion in healthy individuals. © 2017 Ma, Yue, Gong, Zhang, Duan, Shi, Wei and Li.",0.4226415094339623
Individual differences in implicit learning abilities and impulsive behavior in the context of Internet addiction and Internet Gaming Disorder under the consideration of gender,2017,29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014865982&doi=10.1016%2fj.abrep.2017.02.002&partnerID=40&md5=a8a94aa12aa4eee4c08e901a89d7a800,"Introduction In three consecutive studies, we aimed to investigate the relationship between problematic Internet use (PIU), Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and implicit learning abilities, and impulsivity/risk-taking among online video gamers and control participants. Methods In study 1, male visitors, recruited at the “Gamescom” in Cologne (2013), filled in a short version of the Internet Addiction Test (s-IAT), the Online Gaming Addiction Scale (OGAS), and completed an experimental task to assess implicit learning abilities. In study 2, a group of WoW gamers and control participants completed the same set up, in order to replicate the results of study 1. Study 3 used a modified version of the experiment to measure impulsivity/risk-taking in a group of healthy participants. Results In study 1, results revealed a significant negative correlation between the s-IAT score and the measure of implicit learning among male Gamescom participants. In study 2, the s-IAT and WoW addiction scores were negatively correlated with implicit learning only in male WoW players, which mirrors the results from study 1. In study 3, the OGAS score was positively correlated with the experimental measure of impulsivity/risk-taking. Conclusion In the current research project, deficient implicit learning was linked to PIU only in male participants with (a tendency towards) IGD. These findings might help to disentangle some opposing results on this relationship, when considering the gender of participants. Furthermore, higher risk-taking tendencies were associated with IGD among healthy participants, thus, suggesting the potential of risk taking as a predictor of IGD in a non-gamer population. © 2017 The Authors",0.4214876033057851

This model is constructed by the quantum-like approach that employs the state representation specific to quantum theory, which has the mathematical framework beyond the classical probability theory. We show that our quantum approach can clearly explain the famous examples of anomalies for the expected utility theory, the Ellsberg paradox, the Machina paradox and the disparity between WTA and WTP. Further, we point out that our model mathematically specifies the characteristics of the probability weighting function and the value function, which are basic concepts in the prospect theory. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.4406779661016949

Resilience-based interventions offer promise to improve functioning across a number of domains. A four-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted with 790 children affected by parental HIV/AIDS in rural, central China to examine the effects of a multi-level, resilience-based intervention (i.e., ChildCARE) on school outcomes. Child and caregiver dyads were randomized to a control group, child-only intervention, child + caregiver intervention, or child + caregiver + community intervention. School outcomes at 6-, 12-, and 18-months suggest that participation in the ChildCARE program yielded improvements in academic performance, school satisfaction, and school interest. Opportunities for school psychologists to engage in psychosocial and educational intervention for children impacted by HIV/AIDS are discussed. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4573643410852713
Facilitating social play for children with PDDs: Effects of paired robotic devices,2017,15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021309220&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01029&partnerID=40&md5=a25a7e6d2327aac58a08a5130e1c30a4,"Interacting with toys and other people is fundamental for developing social communication skills. However, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are characterized by having a significant impairment in social interaction, which often leads to deficits in play skills. For this reason, methods of teaching play skills to young children with ASD have been well documented. Although previous studies have examined a variety of instructional strategies for teaching skills, few studies have evaluated the potential of using robotic devices. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether automatic feedback provided by colored lights and vibration via paired robotic devices, COLOLO, facilitates social play behaviors in children with ASD. We also explore how social play relates to social interaction. COLOLO is a system of paired spherical devices covered with soft fabric. All participants in this study were recruited as volunteers through the Department of Psychology at Keio University. The pilot study included three participants diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs; 5- to 6-year-old boys), and compared experimental conditions with and without automatic feedback from the devices (colored lights and vibration). The results indicated that the participants in the condition that included feedback from the devices exhibited increased rates of ball contact and looking at the therapist's ball, but did not exhibit increased rates of eye contact or positive affect. In the experimental study, a systematic replication of the pilot study was performed with three other participants diagnosed with PDDs (3- to 6-year-old boys), using an A-B-A-B design. Again, the results demonstrated that, in the condition with colored lights and vibration, the children increased ball contact as well as looking at the therapist's ball. However, the results did not show the effect of automatic feedback consistently for three children. These findings are discussed in terms of the potential of paired robotic devices as a method to facilitate social play for children with ASD. © 2017 Matsuda, Nunez, Hirokawa, Yamamoto and Suzuki.",0.3987341772151899
Useful knowledge and beautiful knowledge in Dewey and Thoreau,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088687189&doi=10.3390%2feducsci7020059&partnerID=40&md5=10db799acb8c9efa71262b0db27c46c1,"In order to see how the wisdom of American pragmatism can be usefully used in response to the crisis of humanities and of democracy and education, the purpose of this paper is to explore elements in Dewey’s thoughts that tend to be hidden in its familiar mainstream reception. The threads of these ideas are evident in Democracy and Education, but they become woven into more explicit expression in Dewey’s later work, particularly in Art as Experience. Following these threads makes it possible to reveal ways of thinking about Dewey’s pragmatism and education that take it beyond its limitations. Those limitations are to be understood in terms of a restricted account of problem-solving, instrumentalism, unqualified aversion to skepticism, and the absence of a tragic sense. Yet a greater sensitivity to these matters is there recessively in Dewey’s writings, and the reading of his work contrapuntally with aspects of Thoreau’s, helps to bring these to light. It is through such a reading that the potential of Dewey’s work as a response to the pressures of a globalized economy come to be seen. © 2017 by the authors.

"Adverse effects of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele on episodic memory, task switching and gray matter volume in healthy young adults",2017,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027887525&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00346&partnerID=40&md5=29a6704a022d04854d8e841d244b4cfb,"Many studies have shown that healthy elderly subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) who carry the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 allele have worse cognitive function and more severe brain atrophy than non-carriers. However, it remains unclear whether this ApoE polymorphism leads to changes of cognition and brain morphology in healthy young adults. In this study, we used an established model to measure verbal episodic memory and core executive function (EF) components (response inhibition, working memory and task switching) in 32 ApoE ε4 carriers and 40 non-carriers between 20 years and 40 years of age. To do this, we carried out an adapted auditory verbal learning test and three computerized EF tasks. High-resolution head magnetic resonance scans were performed in all participants and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used for image processing and analysis. Multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed on memory measures showed that the overall verbal episodic memory of ApoE ε4 carriers was significantly worse than non-carriers (Wilk’s λ = 4.884, P = 0.004). No significant differences were detected in overall EF between the two groups. Post hoc analyses revealed group differences in terms of immediate recall, recognition and task switching, which favored non-carriers. VBM analysis showed gray matter (GM) bilateral reductions in the medial and dorsolateral frontal, parietal and left temporal cortices in the carrier group relative to the non-carrier group, which were most significant in the bilateral anterior and middle cingulate gyri. However, these changes in GM volume were not directly associated with changes in cognitive function. Our data show that the ApoE ε4 allele is associated with poorer performance in verbal episodic memory and task switching, and a reduction in GM volume in healthy young adults, suggesting that the effects of ApoE ε4 upon cognition and brain morphology exist long before the possible occurrence of AD. © 2017 Nao, Sun, Wang, Ma, Zhang, Dong, Ma, Wang and Zheng.",0.47019867549668876
The influence of game genre on Internet gaming disorder,2017,61,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021689561&doi=10.1556%2f2006.6.2017.033&partnerID=40&md5=6526d6ff1a9555470bfaaaea8a403d1e,"Background and aims: Although Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has been investigated in detail, minimal research has been conducted regarding the influence of different game genres on IGD. The aim of this study is to compare the characteristics of members of game genre-specific groups with IGD and to identify factors associated with IGD status in each group in a large sample of adults. Methods: Internet games were categorized into four genres: real-time strategy games, massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG), sport games, and first-person shooter (FPS) games. Participants (n = 2,923) who usually played one of these games completed an anonymous online survey that collected sociodemographic, game usage pattern, and psychopathological assessment data. Results: MMORPG and FPS game players more frequently met the criteria for IGD than participants in the other two groups. Differences between the IGD-suspected gamers within the genre-specific groups were observed for a few items, such as average game-playing time and the subscales of the behavioral activation system; however, the factors that contributed to the development of IGD within each game genre-specific group were found to be considerably different. Discussion and conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that IGD is a stable psychiatric diagnosis encompassing users of a broad range of game genres. In addition, the development of strategies for the prevention of and early intervention on individuals at high risk for developing IGD may require consideration of the distinct characteristics identified as effective predictors of IGD in users of each game genre. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.37398373983739835

This study examined the effect of caring for grandchildren on grandparents’ physical health and the role of intergenerational support from adult children. Longitudinal data derived from a survey on the well-being of older adults in China were used to conduct path analysis of previous grandparent caregivers (vs. noncaregivers) and repeated grandparent caregivers (vs. noncaregivers). The final sample was 799 grandparents aged 60 or older living in rural China. Three aspects of intergenerational support were measured: financial, emotional, and instrumental support. Repeated grandparent caregivers had better self-rated health (SRH) and fewer limitations than noncaregivers. Previous grandparent caregivers had better SRH compared to noncaregivers. Emotional support mediated the relationship between caregiving and SRH among repeated caregivers. Findings suggest that any caregiving experience (previous or repeated) provides health benefits to grandparents. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",0.4791666666666667

This research introduces a data-mining based method to systematically assess the national innovation gap that is specifically for emerging industries. The method examines the five key attributes of emerging industries, including the ownership of platform technologies, globalization intention, international knowledge position, university-industry linkage, and cross-disciplinary technology development. In particular, this method combines data-mining with experts' knowledge to build patent-training examples, and then uses a support vector machine-based classifier to single out all high-quality patents for each innovation attribute. Based on the selected high-quality patents, the authors utilize a factorial design analysis to systematically evaluate the innovation gap between countries. This method can significantly reduce measurement bias of traditional single patent indicators. In addition, it also can robustly adjust measuring weights in response to the specifics of each innovation attribute, while traditional multi-attribute evaluation methods cannot. As a result, this research empirically shows that China’ industrial robot sector has apparent innovation gaps compared to developed economies, specifically in university-industry linkage, cross-disciplinary competence, and globalization intention, and this calls for the attention of policy makers and industrial experts. © 2017 The Authors",0.5128205128205128
Gender-Specificity in Viewing Time Among Heterosexual Women,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981164524&doi=10.1007%2fs10508-016-0795-2&partnerID=40&md5=b0d182e75139fe4e73106b20d9c1140c,"Measures of sexual interest tend to be more gender-specific in heterosexual men than in heterosexual women. Cognitive measures, such as viewing time to attractive stimuli, may also show similar patterns of gender-specificity or nonspecificity among men and women and thus serve as useful adjuncts to more direct measures of sexual interest. The objectives of the present research were to determine the extent of gender-specificity in women’s viewing times for female pictures (varying in their perceived physical attractiveness) and explore the influence of social comparison of physical appearance on these patterns of responses. In Study 1, we recorded only women’s viewing times for pictures of both genders, measured self-reported menstrual cycle phase, and manipulated the waist-to-hip ratio of the women in the female pictures. In Study 2, we recorded women’s and men’s viewing times, self-reported sexual attraction to pictures of males and females, and physical appearance social comparison. Study 1 found that heterosexual women’s viewing time toward female pictures was not associated with manipulation of the perceived attractiveness of those pictures. Study 2 found that heterosexual men were more gender-specific than heterosexual women in their viewing time patterns. We also found that reported sexual attraction and physical appearance social comparison were associated with heterosexual women’s viewing times for female pictures, while heterosexual men’s viewing times were associated with sexual attraction only. Our results are discussed in relation to the utility of viewing time as an indicator of visual attention toward attractive or sexually appealing visual stimuli. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0.5121951219512195

To fill this gap we examined the relationship among delegation, psychological empowerment, and feedback-seeking behavior. We hypothesized that delegation promotes feedback-seeking behavior by psychologically empowering subordinates. In addition, power distance moderates the relationship between delegation and feedback-seeking behavior. Analysis of data from a sample of 248 full-time employees of a hotel group in northern China indicated that delegation predicts subordinates' feedback seeking for individuals with moderate and high power distance orientation, but not for those with low power distance orientation. The mediation hypothesis was also supported. © 2017 Zhang, Qian, Wang, Jin, Wang and Wang.",0.4067796610169492

In the field of early childhood, international comparisons have traditionally been limited to indicators such as infant or child mortality and anthropometric data such as stunting and wasting. However, there has been gradual interest in developing international measures that can be used to compare and monitor the holistic development of children. Using both the short and standard versions of the Early Development Instrument (EDI), this paper reports on the process of adaptation of the EDI in Indonesia. Further, it explores the content and construct validity, internal consistency, inter-rater reliability and predictive validity of the EDI using a number of measures including the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Dimensional Change Card Sort, and school-based tests of language, mathematics and cognitive performance, collected from a number of informants (caregivers, teachers, and children). We report on data for two cohorts of children: the “younger cohort” were approximately 1 year old (N = 3116) and the “older cohort” were approximately 4 years old (N = 3251) at Time 1. Both cohorts were followed up approximately 4 years later, at Time 2.

The neural mechanisms are bimanual-condition specific and therefore should be different between different activities. In this study, we aimed to explore intraregional activation and interregional connectivity during bimanual movement by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Ten right-handed, normal subjects were recruited. The neural correlates of unimanual (right side) and bimanual (in-phase and antiphase) upper limb movements were investigated. Connectivity analyses were carried out using the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) model. The cerebellum was strongly activated in both unimanual and bimanual movements, and the cingulate motor area (CMA) was the most activated brain area in antiphase bimanual movement. Moreover, compared with unimanual movement, CMA activation was also observed in antiphase bimanual movement, but not in in-phase bimanual movement. In addition, we carried out the PPI model to study the differences of effective connectivity and found that the cerebellum was more connected with the CMA during antiphase bimanual movement than in-phase bimanual movement. Our findings elucidate the differences of the cerebellar-cerebral functional connectivity between antiphase and in-phase bimanual movements, which could be used to facilitate the development of a neuroscience perspective on bimanual movement control in patients with motor impairments. © 2017 Qiang Lin et al.",0.3694581280788177

This notion is supported by evidence that detection sensitivity for velocity modulation in moving stimuli is a lowpass function of the velocity modulation's temporal frequency. However, the lowpass function might be a mixture of detection by attention-based tracking and low-level mechanisms sensitive to acceleration. To revisit the issue of acceleration perception in relation to attentive tracking, we measured detection sensitivities for velocity modulations at various temporal frequencies (0.25-8 Hz) by using drifting gratings within long or short spatial windows that make the tracking of grating easier or more difficult respectively. Results showed that modulation sensitivity is lowpass for gratings with long windows but bandpass for gratings with short windows (peak at ~1 Hz). Moreover, we found that lowpass sensitivity becomes bandpass when we removed observer attention by a concurrent letter identification task. An additional visual-search experiment showed that a target dot moving with a velocity modulation at relatively high temporal frequencies (~2-4 Hz) was most easily detected among dots moving at various constant velocities. These results support the notion that high sensitivity to sluggish velocity modulation is a product of attentively tracking of moving stimuli and that the visual system is directly sensitive to accelerations and/or decelerations at the preattentive level.",0.5186915887850467

In our research, we used cross-classified models to study rater effects in the real essay rating process of a large-scale, high-stakes educational examination administered in China in 2011. Generally, four cross-classified models are suggested for investigation of rater effects: (1) the existence of sequential effects, (2) the direction of the sequential effects, and (3) differences in raters by their individual characteristics. We applied these models to the data to account for possible cluster effects caused by the application of multiple rating strategies. The results of our research showed that raters demonstrated sequential effects during the rating process. In contrast to many other studies on rater effects, our study found that raters exhibited assimilation effects. The more experienced, lenient, and qualified raters were less susceptible to assimilation effects. In addition, our research demonstrated the feasibility and appropriateness of using cross-classified models in assessing rater effects for such data structures. This paper also discusses the implications for educators and practitioners who are interested in reducing sequential effects in the rating process, and suggests directions for future research. © 2017 Zhao, Andersson, Guo and Xin.",0.5026737967914439

Compared with the reference stimulus with 4 c/rev (0.64 c/rad), participants consistently overestimated the angular speed for test stimuli of higher radial SFs but underestimated that for a test stimulus of lower radial SFs. The spinner effect increased in magnitude but saturated rapidly as the test radial SF increased. Similar effects were observed with translating linear sinusoidal gratings of different SFs. Our results support the idea that human speed perception is biased by temporal frequency, which physically goes up as SF increases when the speed is held constant. Hence, the more dots or lines, the greater the perceived speed when they are moving coherently in a defined area. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4393063583815029

Their findings revealed that employees' daily work engagement experiences related positively, within individuals, to work-family interpersonal capitalization, which in turn, related positively to daily family satisfaction and to daily work-family balance. The findings also indicate that both the relationship between daily work engagement and work-family interpersonal capitalization and the indirect effects of daily work engagement on the family outcomes were stronger for employees with higher intrinsic motivation than for those with lower intrinsic motivation.

Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that a two-factor model (i.e., physical looming and social looming) fitted the data well across countries. Partial measurement invariance was established for the LMSQ scores across the countries whereas full measurement invariance was achieved across gender. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling was applied to examine the unique contributions of the two looming factors to anxiety and depression symptoms. Results indicated that the test scores underlying two looming factors were crucial and valid predictors of symptoms. The LMSQ shows promise as a measure with cross-cultural generalizability and opens new avenues for its use in diverse cultural settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.46987951807228917
Sensitivity to stroke emerges in kindergartners reading Chinese script,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020388600&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00889&partnerID=40&md5=db2091bcba317033b66da42525d679de,"To what extent are young children sensitive to individual stroke, the smallest unit of writing in Chinese that carries no phonological or semantic information? The present study examined Chinese kindergartners' sensitivity to stroke and the contribution of reading ability and age to stroke sensitivity. Fifty five children from Beijing, including 28 4-year-olds (Mage = 4.55 years, SD = 0.28, 16 males) and 29 5-year-olds (Mage = 5.58 years, SD = 0.30, 14 males), were administered an orthographic matching task and assessed on non-verbal IQ and Chinese word reading. In the orthographic matching task, children were asked to decide whether two items were exactly the same or different in three conditions, with stimuli being correctly written characters (e.g.,), stroke-missing or redundant characters (e.g.,), and Tibetan alphabets (e.g.,), respectively. The stimuli were presented with E-prime 2.0 software and were displayed on a Surface Pro. Children responded by touching the screen and reaction time was used as a measure of processing efficiency. The 5-year-olds but not the 4-year-olds processed correctly written characters more efficiently than stroke-missing/redundant characters, suggesting emergence of stroke sensitivity from age 5. The 4- and 5-year-olds both processed correctly written characters more efficiently than Tibetan alphabets, ruling out the possibility that the 5 year olds' sensitivity to stroke was due to the unusual look of the stimuli. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that Chinese word reading explained 10% additional variance in stroke sensitivity after having statistically controlled for age. Age did not account for additional variance in stroke sensitivity after having considered Chinese word reading. Taken together, findings of this study revealed that despite the visually highly complex nature of Chinese and the fact that individual stroke carries no phonological or semantic information, children develop sensitivity to stroke from age 5 and such sensitivity is significantly associated with reading experience. © 2017 Li and Yin.",0.4295774647887324
Perceived female infidelity and male sexual coercion concerning first sex in Chinese college students' dating relationships: The mediating role of male partners' attachment insecurity,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011968732&doi=10.1016%2fj.paid.2017.02.016&partnerID=40&md5=07104948030e019daae76551bc2cd7ed,"Previous studies have shown that female infidelity, attachment insecurity, and male sexual coercion in intimate relationships are empirically related to each other. However, the mechanisms that are involved remain poorly understood. The study aimed to examine two mediating models of male sexual coercion concerning first sex in Chinese college students' dating relationships (perceived female infidelity or attachment insecurity as the mediator), with both male and female participants (not using dyadic data). A total of 927 validly completed questionnaires provided the data; the respondents were recruited by purposive snowball sampling of students attending colleges in five of China's largest cities who were currently in a romantic relationship. First, with both the male and female samples, perceived female infidelity was positively correlated with violence threat coercive tactics; and, with the male sample only, it was positively correlated with emotional manipulation coercive tactics. Second, with the male sample only, male partners' attachment insecurity (anxiety and avoidance) were positively correlated with perceived female infidelity. Third, male partners' attachment anxiety fully mediated the relationship between perceived female infidelity and emotional manipulation coercive tactics. These findings suggest how the proximate and ultimate causes of sexual coercion in intimate relationships interact. Implications for clinical practice are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.5472636815920398
Peer support and adolescents' physical activity: The mediating roles of self-efficacy and enjoyment,2017,42,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020177138&doi=10.1093%2fjpepsy%2fjsw103&partnerID=40&md5=a3099baa07466e62594320fe33065b6a,"Objective The present study aimed to contrast the mediating magnitude of self-efficacy and enjoyment connecting peer support and adolescents' physical activity (PA). Methods Participants were 9th-12th grade students (N=409; 56.5% boys) who were randomly chosen from six public schools located in Fuzhou city in southeast China. The bootstrapping method in structural equation modeling was conducted to examine the direct and indirect effects of peer support on adolescents' PA. Results Peer support did not directly impact PA. Rather, peer support indirectly influenced PA through either self-efficacy or enjoyment, with self-efficacy demonstrating a stronger mediating effect. Additionally, we found a significant serial mediating effect with enjoyment, and self-efficacy sequentially mediated the relationship between peer support and PA. Conclusion The findings highlight the role of self-efficacy and enjoyment as mediators connecting peer support and PA. Selfefficacy seems to be more important, as it demonstrated a significantly greater mediating effect. © The Author 2016.",0.5374149659863946

A commonly used IT-enabled strategy is to ally with other online sellers by exchanging hyperlinks. This paper provides theoretical guidance to sellers on how to choose partners to improve reciprocity rates in hyperlink formation. Using the resource-based view and transaction-cost rationale, we examine the effects of market conditions and seller reputation on reciprocity link formation, using real transaction data from the largest online marketplace in China. The findings indicate that partners are less likely to exchange hyperlinks if the two sellers sharing a link are in highly overlapping markets and are geographically distant from one another, but the two factors weaken each other's negative effects. The study also explores the moderating effect of seller reputation, and finds that the negative effect of market commonality is weakened by seller reputation. The results of this study can be extended to other types of small business cooperation and are also useful to platform operators for designing mechanisms to encourage cooperation among online sellers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.4126984126984127
Emergence of multimodal action representations from neural network self-organization,2017,34,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016777125&doi=10.1016%2fj.cogsys.2016.08.002&partnerID=40&md5=58702d105c3c13b4dc7560dade26a729,"The integration of multisensory information plays a crucial role in autonomous robotics to forming robust and meaningful representations of the environment. In this work, we investigate how robust multimodal representations can naturally develop in a self-organizing manner from co-occurring multisensory inputs. We propose a hierarchical architecture with growing self-organizing neural networks for learning human actions from audiovisual inputs. The hierarchical processing of visual inputs allows to obtain progressively specialized neurons encoding latent spatiotemporal dynamics of the input, consistent with neurophysiological evidence for increasingly large temporal receptive windows in the human cortex. Associative links to bind unimodal representations are incrementally learned by a semi-supervised algorithm with bidirectional connectivity. Multimodal representations of actions are obtained using the co-activation of action features from video sequences and labels from automatic speech recognition. Experimental results on a dataset of 10 full-body actions show that our system achieves state-of-the-art classification performance without requiring the manual segmentation of training samples, and that congruent visual representations can be retrieved from recognized speech in the absence of visual stimuli. Together, these results show that our hierarchical neural architecture accounts for the development of robust multimodal representations from dynamic audiovisual inputs. © 2016 The Authors",0.4010416666666667

Whilst previous studies have demonstrated this pattern for positive and negative emotions e.g. ‘joy’ and ‘sadness’, the spatial location of neutral emotions, e.g. ‘surprise’, has not been investigated, and little is known about the effect of linguistic background. In this study, we first characterised the emotions joy, surprise and sadness via ratings of their concreteness, imageability, context availability and valence before examining the allocation of these emotions in vertical space. Participants from six linguistic groups completed either a rating task used to characterise the emotions or a word allocation task to implicitly assess where these emotions are positioned in vertical space. Our findings suggest that, across languages, gender, handedness, and ages, positive emotions are located in upper spatial locations and negative emotions in lower spatial locations. In addition, we found that the neutral emotional valence of surprise is reflected in this emotion being mapped mid-way between upper and lower locations onto the vertical plane. This novel finding indicates that the location of a concept on the vertical plane mimics the concept’s degree of emotional valence. © 2016, The Author(s).",0.44776119402985076

In Experiment 1, 28 participants reported how hungry they felt before and after their recollection of certain foods (noodles and pudding). Results suggest that recollection of food increased hunger and that the type of food influenced the degree of hunger (F(2,54) = 31.88, p < .001, η2 = .54). In Experiment 2, 63 participants were randomly assigned to one of three recollection conditions: (1) noodles, (2) pudding, and (3) control. Participants in the two conditions described each food in detail; control group participants did not. Participants were then asked how much they would be willing to participate in an ostensible experiment.

Unfortunately, these institutions all too often fail to respond adequately when girls report acts of cyberviolence committed against them.

This study examined the associations between mother-reported interparental conflict and young children's behavior problems over the first 2 years of their lives in a sample of 212 mothers and infants. Two aspects of maternal sensitivity, sensitivity during distressing and nondistressing contexts, were examined as possible mediators between interparental conflict and infants' behavior problems. Results indicated that interparental conflict was associated directly with infants' externalizing problems over time but was associated indirectly with infants' internalizing problems over time via compromised maternal sensitivity within distressing contexts but not through maternal sensitivity within nondistressing contexts. No significant child gender differences were found. Such findings add to a limited body of research suggesting that the early interparental relationship context is relevant for infant adjustment. The salient mediating role of maternal sensitivity within distressing contexts provides important theoretical and practical insights for future studies. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.558282208588957

Methods The study used baseline data from a randomized controlled trial conducted among 2,448 clients from 68 MMT clinics in five provinces of China. The participants reported their demographic characteristics, treatment-related factors, depressive symptoms, treatment progression, counseling rapport, and treatment satisfaction. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the direct and indirect relationships among various factors and treatment satisfaction. Results Clients' demographic characteristics, such as older age, had both a direct effect on treatment satisfaction and an indirect effect mediated by counseling rapport. Depressive symptoms and a lack of social support had a direct negative impact on treatment satisfaction and an indirect effect mediated by treatment progression and counseling rapport. Both mediators: treatment progression (estimate = 0.227, p < 0.01) and counseling rapport (estimate = 0.229, p < 0.01), showed positive associations with treatment satisfaction. Conclusion The findings reiterate the complex nature of MMT clients' treatment satisfaction and its interrelationship with multidimensional factors. The study has implications for evaluating the quality of care provided by MMT programs and suggests several strategies that can potentially improve MMT clients' level of treatment satisfaction. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.5707317073170731
Negative correlation between serum cytokine levels and cognitive abilities in children with autism spectrum disorder,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061430650&doi=10.3390%2fjintelligence5020019&partnerID=40&md5=a35e80f10fe2036122a4caea36a3a5a0,"Evidence suggests that cytokines may be one of the major factors influencing cognitive development in those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To shed light on the neural and cognitive mechanisms of ASD, we investigated the association between peripheral cytokine levels and cognitive profiles in children with ASD. The serum levels of 10 cytokines (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α) were examined in 14 children with ASD using the Human Ultrasensitive Cytokine Magnetic 10-Plex Panel for the Luminex platform. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) was administered to each subject, and the relationships between WISC scores and serum levels of the cytokines were examined. The full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) was significantly negatively correlated with the levels of IL-6 (Spearman’s rank, p < 0.0001, false discovery rate q < 0.01). The levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ showed significant negative correlations with the verbal comprehension index (p < 0.001, q < 0.01) and working memory index (p < 0.01, q < 0.05), respectively. No other cytokines were significantly correlated with full-scale IQ or with any of the subscale scores of the WISC. The present results suggest negative correlations of IL-6 and IFN-γ levels with cognitive development of children with ASD. Our preliminary findings add to the evidence that cytokines may play a role in the neural development in ASD. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",0.35585585585585583

Three kinds of shadows, a physical hand, a hand-shaped cloth, and a rectangle cloth, were tested for this purpose. The questionnaire results showed that both anatomical similarity and visuo-proprioception correlation were effective in enhancing illusory ownership of the shadow. According to the proprioceptive drift measurement, whether the shadow purely originated from the physical body was a critical factor in yielding the significantly positive drift. Thus, results demonstrated that the shadow can distort illusory ownership with the rubber hand illusion paradigm, but the proprioception was clearly distorted only when the body-shadow was purely applied. This implies the presence of special cognitive processing to discriminate the self-body shadow from the others. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.30935251798561153

This research proposes a residual-based approach to empirically validate Q-matrix specification based on a combination of fit measures. The approach separates Q-matrix validation into four logical steps, including the test-level evaluation, possible distinction between attribute-level and item-level misspecifications, identification of the hit item, and fit information to aid in item adjustment. Through simulation studies and real-life examples, it is shown that the misspecified items can be detected as the hit item and adjusted sequentially when the misspecification occurs at the item level or at random. Adjustment can be based on the maximum reduction of the test-level measures. When adjustment of individual items tends to be useless, attribute-level misspecification is of concern. The approach can accommodate a variety of cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) and be extended to cover other response formats. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4473684210526316

Some traits (extraversion and neuroticism) correlated with adolescents' life satisfaction, while other traits did not have the same associations with adolescents' life satisfaction. In order to explain why the Big Five traits differed in their associations with adolescents' life satisfaction, the present study verified the relations between each of the Big Five personality traits and life satisfaction, and demonstrated the mediating effects of coping style on the relations between these personality traits and life satisfaction in a sample of 2,357 Chinese adolescents. The results demonstrated that four of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism) had significant associations with life satisfaction. Further, coping style partially mediated the relations between these four traits and life satisfaction, whereas coping style fully mediated the relation between openness to new experience and life satisfaction. The results implied a plausible explanation for why the Big Five traits differed in their associations with life satisfaction found among the previous literature: that there might be some partial or full mediation variables (such as coping style in this study) left unexamined.

The identification of factors that predict which patients will successfully maintain weight loss or who are at risk of weight regain after weight loss intervention is necessary to improve the current weight maintenance strategies. The aim of the present study is identify factors associated with successful weight loss maintenance by women with overweight or obesity who completed group cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for weight loss. Methods: Ninety women with overweight or obesity completed a 7-month weight loss intervention. The data of 86 who completed follow-up surveys 12 and 24 months after the end of the treatment was analyzed. Depression, anxiety, binge eating, food addiction, and eating behaviors were assessed before and after the weight loss intervention. Participants who lost at least 10% of their initial weight during the weight loss intervention and had maintained the loss at the month 24 follow-up were defined as successful. Results: The intervention was successful for 27 participants (31.3%) and unsuccessful for 59 (68.6%). Multiple logistic regression analysis extracted larger weight reduction during the weight loss intervention, a lower disinhibition score, and a low food addiction score at the end of the weight loss intervention as associated with successful weight loss maintenance. Conclusion: The results suggest that larger weight reduction during the weight loss intervention and lower levels of disinhibition and food addiction at the end of the weight loss intervention predicted successful weight loss maintenance.

Chinese literacy results in sensitivity to the orthography of Chinese characters. While there is some evidence that this orthographic sensitivity results in an inversion effect, and thus involves configural processing, that processing might depend on exact orthographic properties. Chinese character recognition is believed to involve a hierarchical process, involving at least two lower levels of representation: strokes and radicals. Radicals are grouped into characters according to certain types of structure, i.e. left–right structure, top–bottom structure, or simple characters with only one radical by itself. These types of radical structures vary in both familiarity, and in hierarchical level (compound versus simple characters). In this study, we investigate whether the hierarchical-level or familiarity of radical-structure has an impact on the magnitude of the inversion effect. Participants were asked to do a matching task on pairs of either upright or inverted characters with all the types of structure. Inversion effects were measured based on both reaction time and response sensitivity. While an inversion effect was observed in all 3 conditions, the magnitude of the inversion effect varied with radical structure, being significantly larger for the most familiar type of structure: characters consisting of 2 radicals organized from left to right. These findings indicate that character recognition involves extraction of configural structure as well as radical processing which play different roles in the processing of compound characters and simple characters. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.48582995951417

Neuroimaging studies have revealed that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is closely related to memory retrieval and performance. However, no research has investigated the effect of changing the cortical excitability in right DLPFC on anchoring effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can modulate the excitability of the human cerebral cortex, while anodal and cathodal tDCS are postulated to increase or decrease cortical activity, respectively. In this study, we used tDCS to investigate whether effects of increased or decreased right DLPFC excitability influence anchoring effects in willingness to pay (WTP) experiments. Ninety participants were first randomly assigned to receive either anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation of 15 min, then they performed a valuation task regarding WTP. The results showed that anchoring effects were negatively related to activities of right DLPFC: the anodal stimulation diminished anchoring effects while the cathodal stimulation increased anchoring effects. These outcomes provide one of the first instances of neural evidence for the role of the right DLPFC in anchoring effects and support psychological explanations of the selective accessibility mechanisms and cognitive sets. © 2017 Li, Yin, Li, Liu, Wang and Qu.",0.43147208121827413

The results revealed different patterns for semantic and F0 information. One the one hand, age group modulated significantly the use of F0 contours, indicating that elementary school children relied more on natural F0 contours than middle school children during Mandarin speech recognition. On the other hand, there was no significant modulation effect of age group on semantic context, indicating that children of both age groups used semantic context to assist speech recognition to a similar extent. Furthermore, the significant modulation effect of age group on the interaction between F0 contours and semantic context revealed that younger children could not make better use of semantic context in recognizing speech with flat F0 contours compared with natural F0 contours, while older children could benefit from semantic context even when natural F0 contours were altered, thus confirming the important role of F0 contours in Mandarin speech recognition by elementary school children. The developmental changes in the effects of high-level semantic and low-level F0 information on speech recognition might reflect the differences in auditory and cognitive resources associated with processing of the two types of information in speech perception. © 2017 Zhou, Li, Liang, Guan, Zhang, Shu and Zhang.",0.5042016806722689
Effects of forced movements on learning: Findings from a choice reaction time task in rats,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010822295&doi=10.3758%2fs13420-016-0255-9&partnerID=40&md5=ef121cb10d062a06bce8f314babbba74,"To investigate how motor sensation facilitates learning, we used a sensory–motor association task to determine whether the sensation induced by forced movements contributes to performance improvements in rats. The rats were trained to respond to a tactile stimulus (an air puff) by releasing a lever pressed by the stimulated (compatible condition) or nonstimulated (incompatible condition) forepaw. When error rates fell below 15%, the compatibility condition was changed (reversal learning). An error trial was followed by a lever activation trial in which a lever on the correct or the incorrect response side was automatically elevated at a preset time of 120, 220, 320, or 420 ms after tactile stimulation. This lever activation induced forepaw movement similar to that in a voluntary lever release response, and also induced body movement that occasionally caused elevation of the other forepaw. The effects of lever activation may have produced a sensation similar to that of voluntary lever release by the forepaw on the nonactivated lever. We found that the performance improvement rate was increased by the lever activation procedure on the incorrect response side (i.e., with the nonactivated lever on the correct response side). Furthermore, the performance improvement rate changed depending on the timing of lever activation: Facilitative effects were largest with lever activation on the incorrect response side at 320 ms after tactile stimulation, whereas hindering effects were largest for lever activation on the correct response side at 220 ms after tactile stimulation. These findings suggest that forced movements, which provide tactile and proprioceptive stimulation, affect sensory–motor associative learning in a time-dependent manner. © 2016, The Author(s).",0.43700787401574803
The relationship between salivary amylase and the physical and psychological changes elicited by continuation of autogenic training in patients with functional somatic syndrome,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021275551&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0103-y&partnerID=40&md5=b468f8146e871a8796fec87ca0e1188a,"Background: The aim of this study was to clarify the changes in biological measures during autogenic training (AT) sessions and the relationship between these biological measures and the changes in physical and psychological measures induced by continuation of AT in patients with functional somatic syndrome (FSS). We used the salivary amylase (SAMY) level, skin temperature of the finger (TEMP), subjective symptom scores, and psychological characteristics to assess these changes. Methods: We assessed 24 patients with FSS and 23 healthy controls before and after AT. We then conducted the same tests after the participants had practiced AT at home 1 and 2 months later. Results: The baseline SAMY levels in the first session were significantly higher in the FSS group than in the control group. However, this difference was not significant in the second and third sessions. The pattern of changes in TEMP induced by AT was not different between the FSS and control groups. Tension-anxiety and somatic symptoms in patients with FSS were improved by AT. In the FSS group, the baseline SAMY levels in the first session showed a significant negative correlation with the changes in the subjective symptom score and tension-anxiety score at baseline. Conclusions: The practice of AT, both during the first session and after 1 month of continuation, eased the dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system that is reflected in SAMY in patients with FSS. AT also contributed to decreases in the tension-anxiety and somatic symptoms in patients with FSS. We suggest that SAMY is related to both physical and psychological effects of AT in patients with FSS. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.3667953667953668
What could cognitive capital mean for China's children?,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019231593&doi=10.1002%2fpchj.170&partnerID=40&md5=7f7cb5f004541959bab36c5de4cde102,"Cognitive capital is an emerging paradigm that captures the criticality of investing in children whilst neural proliferation and development of brain architecture are at their peak. Distinct from financial capital, cognitive capital represents investment in future human potential from interventions in nutrition, health, education, child protection, and social welfare systems that optimize brain development. The return on investment is significant given the plasticity of the developing brain in response to positive stimuli. Investment in brain development results in improved health and well-being, educational outcomes, skills, employment, and quality of life. The inverse is also true. Negative stimuli lead to depreciating cognitive capital, poorer mental and physical health and educational outcomes, and decreased life chances. Cognitive capital could be an organizing framework for China's next phase of development to ensure the building of a prosperous society. Through significant commitment from the government, China has seen remarkable improvements in under-five mortality, literacy rates, access to basic education, life expectancy, and gross domestic product in the past few decades as the result of an expansion of publicly funded social services. Yet, inequities remain within and across communities and regions. In 2015, China had a country ranking of 97 for gross national income per capita, highlighting remaining challenges across the whole population. Cognitive capital relies on a package of forward-looking policies that lead to equitable, efficient, and effective use of existing and future resources. This is consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Investments in interventions that maximize optimal brain development in children, realize children's rights, and contribute to future economic growth, defined as “cognitive capital,” represent a significant opportunity for improving children's lives, nation-building, and future economic growth in China. © 2017 The Authors.

Effects of effort and difficulty on human preference for a stimulus: Investigation of the within-trial contrast,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987623632&doi=10.3758%2fs13420-016-0248-8&partnerID=40&md5=bf01a5bc3cd6e2b6045173c940d6cc37,"The within-trial contrast hypothesis (WTC) provides a more parsimonious explanation for the phenomenon that humans and animals prefer outcomes that follow more effortful events to outcomes that follow less effortful events (Zentall, 2013). We conducted two WTC experiments with human adults. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the difficulty of a preceding event by varying the interresponse time and the limited-hold interval during differential reinforcement with a low response rate schedule, to examine the effect of effort on the preference for the subsequent stimuli. In Experiment 2, we attempted to identify the variables that had affected the results of Experiment 1, by manipulating time as the delay of reinforcement. The results showed preferences based on WTC only when participants made a high rate of incorrect responses in the preceding event, which was used as an index of the strength of individual effort. These results extend the findings of previous human WTC studies and suggest that the difficulty of a task could serve as an aversive event that affects the WTC effect. It is possible that an index based on performance in the preceding event would provide useful information for predicting the contrast effect. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.44502617801047123

A total of 199 Hispanic, Korean and Russian participants were interviewed either in their own native language without an interpreter, or through an interpreter. Interviewees either lied or told the truth about a trip they made during the last twelve months. Half of the participants listened to a MS at the beginning of the interview. The dependent variables were ‘detail’, ‘complications’, ‘common knowledge details’, ‘self-handicapping strategies’ and ‘ratio of complications’. In the MS-absent condition, the interviews resulted in less detail when an interpreter was present than when an interpreter was absent. In the MS-present condition, the interviews resulted in a similar amount of detail in the interpreter present and absent conditions. Truthful statements included more complications and fewer common knowledge details and self-handicapping strategies than deceptive statements, and the ratio of complications was higher for truth tellers than liars. The MS strengthened these results, whereas an interpreter had no effect on these results. © 2017",0.45652173913043476
Clinical features of outpatients with somatization symptoms treated at a Japanese psychosomatic medicine clinic,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021279511&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0104-x&partnerID=40&md5=18711d938c0935cc8fa763530d8b8626,"Background: Somatization is produced due to the summation of psychological factors, irrespective of the presence or absence of physical factors. A group of diseases with severe pain and other disorders exhibit so-called Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS), and the characteristics of patients with MUS are largely unexplained. In this paper, the characteristics of a series of new patients with somatization treated in a Japanese university hospital are discussed. Method: The subjects were 871 patients who newly visited the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Toho University Omori Medical Center between January and December of 2015. Under the assumption that the definition of somatization is same as that of MUS, the correlation between somatization and the age, sex, academic background, chief complaints, reasons for visiting the medical center, diagnosis, symptoms, presence or absence of a referral form, continued treatment after the first visit, and marital status of these patients at the time of their respective examinations were evaluated. Results: Of the patients studied, 68% suffered from somatization. Among them, 11% met the definition of Functional Somatic Symptoms (FSS) and 74% had somatization associated with mood disorder or anxiety disorder. Digestive symptoms were reported by 33%, headaches by 24%, and unusual sensations by 21%. Whereas no correlation was found between somatization symptoms and the patients' academic background, marital history, or medical history after the first visit, a positive correlation (p < 0.05) was found between somatization and patients who had been referred by their doctor. Conclusion: Many of the studied patients who suffered from somatization, regardless of age and sex, were referred to us by doctors from other hospitals. It was concluded that many patients difficult to diagnose or deal with are referred the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine of Japanese university hospitals, thus these hospitals must assume great responsibility for preventing mistaken diagnoses by conducting effective psychological treatment and thorough medical examinations. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.43812709030100333
Perceiving animacy from deformation and translation,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020061840&doi=10.1177%2f2041669517707767&partnerID=40&md5=d4eb80063813fea171b72c672de11f6a,"In a cartoon, we often receive an animacy impression from a dynamic nonanimate object, such as a sponge or a flour sack, which does not have an animal-like shape.We hypothesize that the animacy impression of a nonanimal object could stem from dynamic patterns that are possibly fundamental for biological motion perception. Here we show that observers recognize the animacy of human jump actions from the combination of deformation and translation. We extracted vertical motion vectors from the uppermost and lowermost points in point-light jumper stimuli and assigned the vectors to a uniform rectangle. The participants' task was to rate the animacy and jump impressions for the rectangle. Results showed that both animacy and jump impressions for the rectangle movements were comparable to those for the original point-light movements. The impressions decreased for stimuli having a deformation or translation component alone, which was extracted from the original motion vectors. By mathematically simulating deformation and translation in a human jump, we also found that the temporal relation between deformation and translation plays a critical role in the determination of jump impressions but only has a moderate effect for animacy impressions. On the basis of the results, we discuss how cartoon techniques take advantage of the properties of biological motion perception. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4380952380952381
Electrophysiological correlates of cue-related processing in a gambling task: Early outcome evaluation or outcome expectation?,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020696622&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00978&partnerID=40&md5=ccf0eab9b272c771d1232f7e06c39790,"Several recent studies have suggested that cues that predict outcomes elicit a feedback-related-like negativity (FRN-like negativity) reflecting initial appraisals of whether desired outcomes are probable. Some other studies, however, have found that the cues that predict outcomes elicited event-related potentials (ERPs) that reflect the expectation to outcomes (e.g., outcome expectations). Given these mixed findings, this study aimed to examine whether the brain activity elicited by predictive cues in a gambling task reflected the initial evaluations of the outcomes, the outcome expectations, or both. We used a gambling task in which the participants were told to guess which of two doors hid a reward. At the beginning of each trial, a cue was presented to inform the participants of how many doors hid a reward. We found that these predictive cues elicited a FRN-like negativity at the frontal sites within around 200-300 ms. However, this negativity did not significantly differ between the cues that fully predicted gains and the cues that fully predicted losses. Furthermore, predictive cues elicited an expectation-related slow wave, and cues that predicted gains with a 50% probability elicited a larger expectation-related slow wave than cues that fully predicted gains or losses. Our results suggest that cues predicting outcomes reflect outcome expectations rather than initial evaluations of the forthcoming outcomes. © 2017 Zhang, Lin, Takagi and Sai.",0.4418604651162791

Participants comprised of 80 father-child dyads and 169 mother-child dyads from families with ODD children. The results indicated that multilevel family factors were differently associated with children's affective and behavioral ODD symptoms. All the family factors at the dyadic and individual levels were significantly associated with child affective ODD symptoms. However, only the most proximal factors (parent-child relationship and child emotion regulation, which were directly related to child) were significantly related to child behavioral ODD symptoms. The present study extends the current knowledge regarding the relationships between family factors and two dimensions of child ODD symptoms by testing the comprehensive multilevel family factors model. This study also recommends that future interventions for ODD children should consider the multi-level family factors to enhance intervention efficacy. © 2017 Tang, Lin, Chi, Zhou and Hou.",0.4425287356321839
Functional connectivity differences in the insular sub-regions in migraine without aura: A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027843345&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00124&partnerID=40&md5=0b4dcaaef811bb0a750d9fbdd792caaf,"Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate resting-state functional connectivity (FC) differences in insular sub-regions during the interictal phase in patients with migraine without aura (MWoA). Methods: Forty-nine MWoA patients (MWoA group) and 48 healthy individuals (healthy control group) were recruited for this study. All of the subjects underwent neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI data were processed using Brat 1.0 software to obtain a whole-brain FC diagram and using Rest 1.8 software to obtain the FC z-score of the sub-regions of both insulas (six sub-regions on each side). Therefore, there were a total of 12 regions of interest (ROIs) that were used as seed points for the statistical analysis. Results: There was abnormal FC between the insular sub-regions and multiple brain regions in the MWoA patients compared with the healthy control group, and a clear laterality was also observed. In addition, the FC z-score of certain sub-regions was negatively correlated with the disease duration. Conclusion: Different insular sub-regions are functionally associated with different regions of the brain and therefore have different functions. In MWoA, the FC between the insular sub-regions and other brain regions was mostly reduced, while a small amount was increased; additionally, the FC may be ipsilateral with a right-side advantage. Variations in the FC of insular sub-regions can be observed as an important indicator of MWoA. © 2017 Yu, Lv, Song, Liu, Huang, Hu, Zuo, Wang, Yang, Peng, Zhou and Li.",0.3547008547008547

However, due to its nature, frequencies could be used as stimuli are scarce. To solve such problem, a stimuli encoding method which encodes SSVEP signal using Frequency Shift–Keying (FSK) method is developed. In this method, each stimulus is controlled by a FSK signal which contains three different frequencies that represent “Bit 0,” “Bit 1” and “Bit 2” respectively. Different to common BFSK in digital communication, “Bit 0” and “Bit 1” composited the unique identifier of stimuli in binary bit stream form, while “Bit 2” indicates the ending of a stimuli encoding. EEG signal is acquired on channel Oz, O1, O2, Pz, P3, and P4, using ADS1299 at the sample rate of 250 SPS. Before original EEG signal is quadrature demodulated, it is detrended and then band-pass filtered using FFT-based FIR filtering to remove interference. Valid peak of the processed signal is acquired by calculating its derivative and converted into bit streamusing window method. Theoretically, this coding method could implement at least 2n−1 (n is the length of bit command) stimulus while keeping the ITR the same. This method is suitable to implement stimuli on a monitor and where the frequency and phase could be used to code stimuli is limited as well as implementing portable BCI devices which is not capable of performing complex calculations. © 2017 Zhao, Zhao, Wang and Hou.",0.3744493392070485

The effectiveness of tDCS is influenced by its stimulation parameters, but there have been no systematic studies to help guide the selection of different parameters.Objective: This study aims to assess the effects of tDCS of primary motor cortex (M1) on chronic neuropathic pain in rats and to test for the optimal parameter combinations for analgesia.Methods: Using the chronic neuropathic pain models of chronic constriction injury (CCI), we measured pain thresholds before and after anodal-tDCS (A-tDCS) using different parameter conditions, including stimulation intensity, stimulation time, intervention time and electrode located (ipsilateral or contralateral M1 of the ligated paw on male/female CCI models).Results: Following the application of A-tDCS over M1, we observed that the antinociceptive effects were depended on different parameters. First, we found that repetitive A-tDCS had a longer analgesic effect than single stimulus, and both ipsilateral-tDCS (ip-tDCS) and contralateral-tDCS (con-tDCS) produce a long-lasting analgesic effect on neuropathic pain. Second, the antinociceptive effects were intensity-dependent and time-dependent, high intensities worked better than low intensities and long stimulus durations worked better than short stimulus durations. Third, timing of the intervention after injury affected the stimulation outcome, early use of tDCS was an effective method to prevent the development of pain, and more frequent intervention induced more analgesia in CCI rats, finally, similar antinociceptive effects of con- and ip-tDCS were observed in both sexes of CCI rats.Conclusion: Optimized protocols of tDCS for treating antinociceptive effects were developed. These findings should be taken into consideration when using tDCS to produce analgesic effects in clinical applications. © 2017 Wen, Gao, Zhao, He, Tian and Ruan.",0.40213523131672596

The app is called Component Extraction and Motion Integration Test (CEMIT). Observers are asked to respond to the direction of translating plaids that move in one of two very different directions. The plaids have been selected so that the plaid components move in one of the directions and the plaid pattern moves in the other direction. In addition to correctly responding to the pattern motion, observers demonstrate their ability to correctly extract the movement (and therefore the orientation) of the underlying components at specific spatial frequencies. We wanted to test CEMIT by seeing if we could replicate the broader tuning observed at low spatial frequencies for this type of plaid. Results from CEMIT were robust and successfully replicated this result for 50 typical observers. We envisage that it will be of use to researchers and clinicians by allowing them to investigate specific deficits at this fundamental level of cortical visual processing. CEMIT may also be used for screening purposes where visual information plays an important role, for example, air traffic controllers. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.526595744680851

In two between-participant groups, children either just heard or heard and repeated WANT-to, WANT-X, and control prime sentences after which to-infinitival constructions were elicited. We found that both age groups were primed, but in different ways. In the 2;6–3;0 year olds, WANT-to primes facilitated the provision of to in target utterances relative to the control contexts, but no significant effect was found for WANT-X primes. In the 3;6–4;0 year olds, both WANT-to and WANT-X primes showed a priming effect, namely WANT-to primes facilitated and WANT-X primes inhibited provision of to. We argue that these effects reflect developmental differences in the level of proficiency in and preference for the two constructions, and they are broadly consistent with “priming as implicit learning” accounts. The current study shows that (a) children as young as 2;6–3;0 years of age can be primed when they have only heard (not repeated) particular constructions, (b) children are acquiring at least two constructions for the matrix verb WANT, and (c) that these two WANT-constructions compete for production.

Based on earlier neurophysiological studies, we investigated the correlation between the five personality traits assessed by the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) at four distinct frequency bands (slow-5 (0.01–0.027 Hz), slow-4 (0.027–0.073 Hz), slow-3 (0.073–0.198 Hz) and slow-2 (0.198–0.25 Hz)). We enrolled 835 young subjects and calculated the correlations of resting-state fMRI signals using a multiple regression analysis. We found a significant and consistent correlation between fALFF and the personality trait of extraversion at all frequency bands. Furthermore, significant correlations were detected in distinct brain regions for each frequency band. This finding supports the frequency-specific spatial representations of personality traits as previously suggested. In conclusion, our data highlight an association between human personality traits and fALFF at four distinct frequency bands. © 2017 Ikeda, Takeuchi, Taki, Nouchi, Yokoyama, Kotozaki, Nakagawa, Sekiguchi, Iizuka, Yamamoto, Hanawa, Araki, Miyauchi, Sakaki, Nozawa, Yokota, Magistro and Kawashima.",0.4340659340659341
Can Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Be Distinguished From ADHD Inattention in Very Young Children? Evidence From a Sample of Korean Preschool Children,2017,23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019167648&doi=10.1177%2f1087054716680077&partnerID=40&md5=326e7a12b48bae0737e1c5a689818562,"Objective: This study evaluated whether sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is separable from ADHD–inattention (IN) and uniquely associated with internalizing dimensions in preschool children in South Korea. Method: Mothers of 172 preschool children (ages 4-6 years; 52% girls) rated children’s SCT, ADHD-IN, ADHD–hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), aggression, emotional reactivity, anxiety/depression, somatic complaints, withdrawal, and sleep problems. Results: Eight of 10 SCT symptoms showed convergent and discriminant validity with ADHD-IN. ADHD-IN remained significantly positively associated with ADHD-HI, ODD, and aggressive behavior after controlling for SCT, whereas SCT was no longer positively associated with these externalizing behaviors after controlling for ADHD-IN. Both SCT and ADHD-IN were uniquely associated with greater emotionally reactivity, anxiety/depression, and withdrawal. Only SCT was uniquely associated with somatic complaints, and only ADHD-IN was uniquely associated with sleep problems. Conclusion: Findings replicate results with children and adolescents, thus expanding evidence for the validity of SCT in early development. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",0.3716216216216216
Evaluation of behavioral change after adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children with autism spectrum disorder,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019146435&doi=10.1016%2fj.ridd.2017.04.012&partnerID=40&md5=66dfd55803f3c0e4f34f454f0004b409,"Background and objective Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may affect daily cognitive functioning in children. The aims of our study were two-fold. The first aim was to detect, using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), whether adenotonsillectomy (AT) for the treatment of OSA improved the behavior of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The second aim was to identify characteristics for behavioral improvement following the treatment of OSA in these children with ASD. Methods The behaviors of ASD children aged 5–14 years diagnosed as having OSA (n = 30) were evaluated using CBCL before and after AT. CBCL evaluation of ASD children without OSA at two time points with the same interval served as a control (n = 24). We statistically examined the two groups. In addition, we conducted a paired t-test to assess changes in CBCL Tscores between the improved group and unchanged/deteriorated group to identify characteristics that may affect behavioral changes following OSA treatment. Results After AT, T-scores of the CBCL scales were significantly improved in the OSA group, but no change was observed in the control. A paired t-test revealed that the improved group had significantly higher scores on the CBCL pre-AT than the unchanged/deteriorated group in ASD children with OSA after OSA treatment. Conclusions Behavioral problems were significantly improved following AT in ASD children with OSA. Early detection and treatment of children with OSA is essential to prevent behavioral problems and to support mental development. © 2017 The Author(s)",0.358974358974359

There have been a few brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies for GD, although the results have been inconsistent. On the other hand, GD was suggested to be a heterogeneous disorder in terms of risk attitude. We aimed to examine the heterogeneity of GD by combining a behavioral economics task and voxel-based morphometry. Thirty-six male GD patients and 36 healthy male control subjects underwent a task for estimation of loss aversion, which can assess risk attitude in real-life decision-making. The GD patients were divided into two groups based on their level of loss aversion, low and high. While both groups showed common gray matter volume reduction in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral posterior cerebellum, high loss-aversion GD showed pronounced reduction in the left posterior cerebellum and additional reduction in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our study suggests that the heterogeneity of GD is underpinned at the brain structural level. This result might be useful for understanding neurobiological mechanisms and for the establishment of precise treatment strategies for GD. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.4029126213592233

Fear extinction, which involves learning to suppress the expression of a previously learned fear, appears to require the dopaminergic system. The specific roles of D2 receptors in mediating associative learning underlying fear extinction require further study. Intra-basolateral amygdala (BLA) infusions of a D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, and a D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride, prior to fear extinction and extinction retention were tested 24 h after fear extinction training for long-term memory (LTM). LTM was facilitated by quinpirole and attenuated by sulpiride. In addition, A-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) subunit, GluR1 phospho-Ser845, and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor NR2B subunit levels in the BLA were generally increased by quinpirole and down-regulated by sulpiride. The present study suggests that activation of D2 receptors facilitates fear extinction and that blockade of D2 receptors impairs fear extinction, accompanied by changes in GluR1, GluR1-Ser845 and NR2B levels in the amygdala. © 2017 Shi, Fan, Xue, Wen and Zhao.",0.47701149425287354
Association of social support with gratitude and sense of coherence in Japanese young women: A cross-sectional study,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021759949&doi=10.2147%2fPRBM.S137374&partnerID=40&md5=5c71678ba7c2553024e92255d931375f,"Purpose: Recent studies have shown that perceived social support is associated with gratitude and sense of coherence, but evidence for this concept remains scarce. In the present study, we investigated relationships between social support, gratitude, and sense of coherence, focusing on the construct of and source of social support among young women. Methods: The study was conducted in 2014 in Japan. Participants comprised 208 female university students (aged 19.9 ± 1.1 years), who completed a self-administered anonymous questionnaire regarding perceived social support, gratitude, and sense of coherence. Results: Emotional and instrumental social support from acquaintances were found to be lower than those from family and friends. Gratitude was positively correlated with all forms of social support except instrumental social support from acquaintances. However, sense of coherence was positively correlated with both emotional and instrumental social support from family and only emotional social support from acquaintances. Multiple regression analysis showed that emotional support from family and emotional support from acquaintances were positively associated with gratitude whereas emotional support from family was associated with sense of coherence. Conclusion: These results indicate that emotional social support from family was related to both gratitude and sense of coherence. © 2017 Fujitani et al.",0.5572916666666666

Specifically, we proposed that transformational leadership influences employee voice through leaders' voice expectation and employees' voice role perception (i.e., Pygmalion mechanism). We also theorized that personal identification with transformational leaders influences the extent to which employees internalize leaders' external voice expectation as their own voice role perception. In a time-lagged field study, we found that leaders' voice expectation and employees' voice role perception (i.e., the Pygmalion process) mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and voice behavior. In addition, we found transformational leadership strengthens employees' personal identification with the leader, which in turn, as a moderator, amplifies the proposed Pygmalion process. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0.45323741007194246

We manipulated the degree of class separation, sample size, the magnitude of covariate effect on class membership, the covariance between the intercept and the slope, and fit two models with covariates and an unconditional model. We concluded that correct class identification in GMM requires large sample sizes and class separation, and that unconditional GMM performs better than GMM with covariates if the sample size and class separation are sufficiently large. With small sample sizes, GMM with covariates outperformed unconditional GMM, but the percentage of correct class enumeration was low across different fit criteria. © 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.5213675213675214
Neural temporal dynamics of facial emotion processing: Age effects and relationship to cognitive function,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021710397&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01110&partnerID=40&md5=2adf2d561437458e5ca09fac11fde899,"This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the effects of age on neural temporal dynamics of processing task-relevant facial expressions and their relationship to cognitive functions. Negative (sad, afraid, angry, and disgusted), positive (happy), and neutral faces were presented to 30 older and 31 young participants who performed a facial emotion categorization task. Behavioral and ERP indices of facial emotion processing were analyzed. An enhanced N170 for negative faces, in addition to intact right-hemispheric N170 for positive faces, was observed in older adults relative to their younger counterparts. Moreover, older adults demonstrated an attenuated within-group N170 laterality effect for neutral faces, while younger adults showed the opposite pattern. Furthermore, older adults exhibited sustained temporo-occipital negativity deflection over the time range of 200-500 ms post-stimulus, while young adults showed posterior positivity and subsequent emotion-specific frontal negativity deflections. In older adults, decreased accuracy for labeling negative faces was positively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scores, and accuracy for labeling neutral faces was negatively correlated with age. These findings suggest that older people may exert more effort in structural encoding for negative faces and there are different response patterns for the categorization of different facial emotions. Cognitive functioning may be related to facial emotion categorization deficits observed in older adults. This may not be attributable to positivity effects: it may represent a selective deficit for the processing of negative facial expressions in older adults. © 2017 Liao, Wang, Lin, Chan and Zhang.",0.625531914893617
Motion event similarity judgments in one or two languages: An exploration of monolingual speakers of English and Chinese vs. L2 learners of English,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020392132&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00909&partnerID=40&md5=3432d060ecb1c49c892255d27eeee26e,"Languages differ systematically in how to encode a motion event. English characteristically expresses manner in verb root and path in verb particle; in Chinese, varied aspects of motion, such as manner, path and cause, can be simultaneously encoded in a verb compound. This study investigates whether typological differences, as such, influence how first and second language learners conceptualize motion events, as suggested by behavioral evidences. Specifically, the performance of Chinese learners of English, at three proficiencies, was compared to that of two groups of monolingual speakers in a triads matching task. The first set of analyses regarding categorisation preferences indicates that participants across groups preferred the path-matched (rather than manner-matched) screens. However, the second set of analyses regarding reaction time suggests, firstly, that English monolingual speakers reacted significantly more quickly in selecting the manner-matched scenes compared with monolingual speakers of Chinese, who tended to use an approximately equal amount of time in making manner- and path-matched decisions, a finding that can arguably be mapped onto the typological difference between the two languages. Secondly, the pattern of response latency in low-level L2 learners looked more like that of monolingual speakers of Chinese. Only at intermediate and advanced levels of acquisition did the behavioral pattern of L2 learners become target-like, thus suggesting language-specific constraints from the L1 at an early stage of acquisition. Overall, our results suggest that motion event cognition may be linked to, among other things, the linguistic structure of motion description in particular languages. © 2017 Ji.",0.43089430894308944
What property of the contour of a deforming region biases percepts toward liquid?,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020712782&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01014&partnerID=40&md5=a784b7bdf93c9e4f273c36acb2695d4f,"Human observers can perceive the existence of a transparent surface from dynamic image deformation. They can also easily discriminate a transparent solid material such as plastic and glass from a transparent fluid one such as water and shampoo just by viewing them. However, the image information required for material discrimination of this sort is still unclear. A liquid changes its contour shape non-rigidly. We therefore examined whether additional properties of the contour of a deformation-defined region, which indicated contour non-rigidity, biased percepts of the region toward liquid materials. Our stimuli had a translating circular region wherein a natural texture image was deformed at the spatiotemporal deformation frequency that was optimal for the perception of a transparent layer. In Experiment 1, we dynamically deformed the contour of the circular region and found that large deformation of the contour biased the percept toward liquid. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the blurriness of the contour and observed that a strongly blurred contour biased percepts toward liquid. Taken together, the results suggest that a deforming region lacking a discrete contour biases percepts toward liquid. © 2017 Kawabe.",0.4692737430167598
Spatial frequency shifts from counterphase flicker and from simultaneous contrast,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020113076&doi=10.1177%2f2041669517707766&partnerID=40&md5=cfc3b14eaa51770843a5665d399d38ed,"In simultaneous contrast of spatial frequency (SF), a test grating surrounded by a coarser inducing grating looks apparently finer. We combined this effect with another visual illusion; the fact that flickering the inducing grating raises its apparent SF. We found that the inducer's apparent, not physical spatial frequency, drove the simultaneous contrast that it induced into a test grating. Thus, when the inducer was made to flicker, its SF appeared to be higher and consequently, the test's SF appeared lower than before. This suggests that simultaneous contrast of spatial frequency exists further downstream than the flicker-induced increase in perceived SF. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4215686274509804

The current experiments investigate how testing expectations impact the study of and memory for valuable information. Participants studied lists of words ranging in value from 1 to 10 points with the goal being to maximize their score on a later memory test. Half of the participants were told to expect a recognition test after each list, whereas the other half were told to expect a recall test. After several lists of receiving tests congruent with expectations, participants studying for a recognition test instead received an unexpected recall test. In Experiment 1, participants who had studied for a recognition test recalled less of the valuable information than participants anticipating the recall format. These participants continued to attend less to item value on future (expected) recall tests than participants who had only ever experienced recall testing. When the recognition tests were made more demanding in Experiment 2, value-based recall improved relative to Experiment 1: though memory for the valuable information remained superior when participants studied with the expectation of having to recall the information, there were no longer significant differences after accounting for recall testing experience. Thus, recall-based testing encouraged strategic, value-based encoding and enhanced retrieval of important information, whereas recognition testing in some cases limited value-based study and memory. These results extend prior work concerning the impact of testing expectations on memory, offering further insight into how people study important information. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.5582329317269076

Neurofeedback training, which enables the individuals to regulate their brain activity using a real-time feedback loop, is increasingly investigated as a potential alternative intervention for schizophrenia. This study aimed to explore the effect of short but intensive neurofeedback training for schizophrenic patients with difficulty for long-time training. A middle-aged woman with chronic schizophrenia completed the intensive training of alpha/beta2 (20-30 Hz) in four consecutive days with a total training duration of 13.5 hours. The results showed that her alpha/beta2 increased over sessions, and her behavior performance including short-term memory, mood, and speech pattern was improved at the end of neurofeedback training. Importantly, a 22-month follow-up found a dramatic improvement in both positive and negative symptoms. These positive outcomes suggest that such intensive neurofeedback training may provide new insight into the treatment of schizophrenia and thus deserves further study to fully examine its scope. © 2017 Wenya Nan et al.",0.40372670807453415

One such system, the HTC Vive, offers a large field-of-view, high-resolution head mounted display together with a room-scale tracking system for less than a thousand U.S. dollars. If the position and orientation tracking of this system is of sufficient accuracy and precision, it could be suitable for much research that is currently done with far more expensive systems. Here we present a quantitative test of the HTC Vive's position and orientation tracking as well as its end-to-end system latency. We report that while the precision of the Vive's tracking measurements is high and its system latency (22 ms) is low, its position and orientation measurements are provided in a coordinate system that is tilted with respect to the physical ground plane. Because large changes in offset were found whenever tracking was briefly lost, it cannot be corrected for with a one-time calibration procedure.We conclude that the varying offset between the virtual and the physical tracking space makes the HTC Vive at present unsuitable for scientific experiments that require accurate visual stimulation of self-motion through a virtual world. It may however be suited for other experiments that do not have this requirement. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4597156398104265

In tshe present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of a sequence that integrated space and color sequences on early and late learning phases (corresponding to effector-independent and effector-dependent learning, respectively) and how the effects differed in the integrated and primary sequences in each learning phase. In the task, the participants were required to learn a sequence of button presses using trial-and-error and to perform the sequence successfully for 20 trials (m × n task). First, in the baseline task, all participants learned a non-colored sequence, in which the response button always turned red. Then, in the learning task, the participants were assigned to two groups: a colored sequence group (i.e., space and color) or a non-colored sequence group (i.e., space). In the colored sequence, the response button turned a pre-determined color and the participants were instructed to attend to the sequences of both location and color as much as they could. The results showed that the participants who performed the colored sequence acquired the correct button presses of the sequence earlier, but showed a slower mean performance time than those who performed the non-colored sequence. Moreover, the slower performance time in the colored sequence group remained in a subsequent transfer task in which the spatial configurations of the buttons were vertically mirrored from the learning task. These results indicated that if participants explicitly attended to both the spatial response sequence and color stimulus sequence at the same time, they could develop their spatial representations of the sequence earlier (i.e., early development of the effector-independent learning), but might not be able to enhance their motor representations of the sequence (i.e., late development of the effector-dependent learning). Thus, the undeveloped effector-dependent representations in the colored sequence group directly led to a long performance time in the transfer sequence.

Past studies using looking time techniques suggest that English-speaking 3-year-olds show language-specific action processing, but 2.5-year-olds preferentially attend to path regardless of native language. In Study 1, we test whether language-specific action component preferences will be reflected in children's imitation, as a more explicit measure. Children who spoke English saw an adult move an object along a series of platforms using one of two paths and manners. Then, the children were given the opportunity to move the object on a different test platform, which was designed to force them to choose to reproduce either the demonstrated path or the manner. The results showed that 3-year-olds, but not 2.5-year-olds, were more likely to imitate the manner versus the path. In Study 2, we extend the investigation to a less commonly studied language within this domain, Mandarin. Typically in Mandarin, an ""equipollently framed"" language, both manner and path are expressed within equally significant verbs. The results indicated that 3-year-olds did not show a consistent preference to imitate either the path or the manner. In contrast, 2.5-year-olds were more likely to imitate the path than the manner. This research highlights the potential for the imitation choice paradigm, as an explicit measure, to understand how language affects cognition, and suggests a new language-specific pattern in action interpretation. © 2017 Wang and Wang.",0.41201716738197425

Using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and Granger Causality Analysis (GCA) methods, the current developmental study aimed to identify the difference in the relationship between the connections of VWFA-language areas and reading performance in both adults and children. The results showed that: (1) the spontaneous connectivity between VWFA and the spoken language areas, i.e., the left inferior frontal gyrus/supramarginal gyrus (LIFG/LSMG), was stronger in adults compared with children; (2) the spontaneous functional patterns of connectivity between VWFA and language network were negatively correlated with reading ability in adults but not in children; (3) the causal influence from LIFG to VWFA was negatively correlated with reading ability only in adults but not in children; (4) the RSFCs between left posterior middle frontal gyrus (LpMFG) and VWFA/LIFG were positively correlated with reading ability in both adults and children; and (5) the causal influence from LIFG to LSMG was positively correlated with reading ability in both groups. These findings provide insights into the relationship between VWFA and the language network for reading, and the role of the unique features of Chinese in the neural circuits of reading. © 2017 Li, Zhang, Xia, Yang, Shu and Li.",0.41013824884792627

The central issue in the field of social cognition has been theory of mind (ToM), and there has been debate regarding its nature as either theory-theory or as simulation theory. Insights from phenomenology have brought a second-person perspective based on embodied interactions into the debate, thereby forming a third position known as IT. In this article, I examine how IT can be further elaborated by drawing on two phenomenological notions—Merleau-Ponty’s intercorporeality and Kimura’s aida. Both of these notions emphasize the sensory-motor, perceptual, and non-conceptual aspects of social understanding and describe a process of interpersonal coordination in which embodied interaction gains autonomy as an emergent system.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of current and previous parental migration on child psychosocial well-being, with a focus on emotional and behavioral outcomes, while considering factors in family care and support. Methods: Children were recruited from schools in migrant-sending rural areas in Zhejiang and Guizhou provinces by random stratified sampling. A self-administered questionnaire measured children’s psychosocial well-being, demographics, household characteristics, and social support. Multiple linear regression models examined the effects of parental migration and other factors on psychosocial difficulties. Results: Data from 1930 current, 907 previous, and 701 never LBC were included (mean age 12.4, SD 2.1). Adjusted models showed both previous and current parental migration was associated with significantly higher overall psychosocial difficulties, involving aspects of emotion, conduct, peer relationships, hyperactivity, and pro-social behaviors. Parental divorce and lack of available support demonstrated a strong association with greater total difficulties. While children in Guizhou had much worse psychosocial outcomes than those in Zhejiang, adjusted subgroup analysis showed similar magnitude of between-province disparities regardless of parental migration status. However, having divorced parents and lack of support were greater psychosocial risk factors for current and previous-LBC than for never LBC. Conclusions: Parental migration has an independent, long-lasting adverse effect on children. Psychosocial well-being of LBC depends more on the relationship bonds between nuclear family members and the availability of support, rather than socioeconomic status. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.44813278008298757
Tolerating dissimilar other when primed with death: Neural evidence of self-control engaged by interdependent people in Japan,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027270355&doi=10.1093%2fscan%2fnsx012&partnerID=40&md5=5a25f49dd5450bcf7269e59f0ccfb586,"Mortality salience (MS) has been shown to lead to derogation of others with dissimilar worldviews, yet recent research has shown that Asian-Americans who presumably adopt an interdependent self-construal (SC) tend to reveal greater tolerance after MS induction. In the present study, we demonstrated that Japanese individuals who are high on interdependent SC indeed show greater tolerance toward worldview-threatening other in the MS (vs control) condition, thus replicating the prior research. Extending this research, we also found that interdependent people's tolerance toward worldview-threatening other was mediated by increased activity in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the MS condition. These data suggested that when exposed to death-related stimuli, highly interdependent individuals may spontaneously activate their neural self-control system which may serve to increase tolerance toward others. © The Author (2017).

Limited individual attention and online virality of low-quality information,2017,100,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034416021&doi=10.1038%2fs41562-017-0132&partnerID=40&md5=2a1ea3c739a761ca9acf69ab41dda695,"Social media are massive marketplaces where ideas and news compete for our attention 1. Previous studies have shown that quality is not a necessary condition for online virality 2 and that knowledge about peer choices can distort the relationship between quality and popularity 3. However, these results do not explain the viral spread of low-quality information, such as the digital misinformation that threatens our democracy 4. We investigate quality discrimination in a stylized model of an online social network, where individual agents prefer quality information, but have behavioural limitations in managing a heavy flow of information. We measure the relationship between the quality of an idea and its likelihood of becoming prevalent at the system level. We find that both information overload and limited attention contribute to a degradation of the market's discriminative power. A good tradeoff between discriminative power and diversity of information is possible according to the model. However, calibration with empirical data characterizing information load and finite attention in real social media reveals a weak correlation between quality and popularity of information. In these realistic conditions, the model predicts that low-quality information is just as likely to go viral, providing an interpretation for the high volume of misinformation we observe online.",0.435
Accuracy and tuning of flow parsing for visual perception of object motion during self-motion,2017,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020088939&doi=10.1177%2f2041669517708206&partnerID=40&md5=240cc318f92a235264cb67de2d78db74,"How do we perceive object motion during self-motion using visual information alone? Previous studies have reported that the visual system can use optic flow to identify and globally subtract the retinal motion component resulting from self-motion to recover scene-relative object motion, a process called flow parsing. In this article, we developed a retinal motion nulling method to directly measure and quantify the magnitude of flow parsing (i.e., flow parsing gain) in various scenarios to examine the accuracy and tuning of flow parsing for the visual perception of object motion during self-motion. We found that flow parsing gains were below unity for all displays in all experiments; and that increasing self-motion and object motion speed did not alter flow parsing gain. We conclude that visual information alone is not sufficient for the accurate perception of scene-relative motion during self-motion. Although flow parsing performs global subtraction, its accuracy also depends on local motion information in the retinal vicinity of the moving object. Furthermore, the flow parsing gain was constant across common self-motion or object motion speeds. These results can be used to inform and validate computational models of flow parsing. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.49473684210526314
Cannot avert the eyes: reduced attentional blink toward others’ emotional expressions in empathic people,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991079637&doi=10.3758%2fs13423-016-1171-x&partnerID=40&md5=94f144bc84359da7d873f4b2be315800,"Empathy is one of the core components of social interaction. Although current models of empathy emphasize the role of attention, few studies have directly examined the relationship between attentional processes and individual differences in empathy. This study hypothesized that empathic people would process emotional expressions more efficiently and automatically compared to less empathic people. Crucially, such a processing advantage should be present only for faces of others compared to one’s own face. To test this hypothesis, 100 healthy participants varying in their self-reported empathy levels underwent an attentional blink task that tested preferential attentional processing. Results showed a diminished attentional blink effect for sad faces of others in the high-empathy group. Additionally, performance differences in the task were related to both trait empathy and daily prosocial behavior. Overall, our results show that emotional stimuli preferentially capture the attention of empathic people, leading to automatic processing. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4489795918367347

We investigated the attentional effect to the action itself on the observation inflation. Fifty-four participants first performed and read actions (Phase 1); then, they observed the action video that showed another's actions (Phase 2), some of which they had not performed in Phase 1. In the Phase 2, they were required to focus on either the actor's performance (i.e., attentive observation condition) or irrelevant objects, which were presented in the background (i.e., inattentive observation condition) to modulate their attention. Around 2 weeks later, participants took a surprise source-memory test (Phase 3). In this phase, we asked them to judge whether they ""performed,"" ""read,"" or ""not presented"" the action in Phase 1. Three participants were removed from analysis, because they could not attend Phase 3 within 10-16 days after completion of the second phase. We found observation inflation only in the attentive condition, which contradicted the notions from other false memory studies that showed that attention to the target stimuli reduced false memory in general. We discussed the observation inflation mechanism from the perspective of the ""like me"" system, including the mirror neuron system, self-ownership, and self-agency. © 2017 Kashihara, Kanayama, Miyatani and Nakao.",0.4439252336448598

Both operational activities and warehouse configurations are continually monitored to facilitate real-time response. We study the dynamics of a flexible warehouse scenario where items of any type can be dropped off anywhere within the premises. Unlike existing models, we relax both the location constraint and local (e.g., item-type level) capacity constraints with a periodically renewable fixed global capacity. Dynamic decisions on location and local capacity are made based on the stochastic Markovian demand states. We optimize processing and routing constraints and compare the performance of this flexible storage setup with classical models through multiple levels of real-time decision support. Our results provide corroborating evidence to support the following observations: (1) “free pick-n-drop” combined with fluid warehousing mechanism greatly reduces trip costs and lead time for single trip demand, (2) there exists a lower bound on the performance in such a setup with fixed local capacities, and (3) the lower bound can be further improved when inventory capacity and location are dynamically adjusted according to actual demand patterns. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.5187165775401069

In the experiment, subjects choose to join one of two committees (weighted voting games) and obtain a payoff stochastically determined by a voting theory. We found that: (i) subjects learned to choose the committee that generates a higher expected payoff even without feedback about the payoffs they received; (ii) there was statistically significant evidence of “meaningful learning” (transfer of learning) only for the treatment with no payoff-related feedback.

Orthographic effects in spoken word recognition: Evidence from Chinese,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986302037&doi=10.3758%2fs13423-016-1164-9&partnerID=40&md5=1af2f8966ffc8fb5855f30c324120300,"Extensive evidence from alphabetic languages demonstrates a role of orthography in the processing of spoken words. Because alphabetic systems explicitly code speech sounds, such effects are perhaps not surprising. However, it is less clear whether orthographic codes are involuntarily accessed from spoken words in languages with non-alphabetic systems, in which the sound-spelling correspondence is largely arbitrary. We investigated the role of orthography via a semantic relatedness judgment task: native Mandarin speakers judged whether or not spoken word pairs were related in meaning. Word pairs were either semantically related, orthographically related, or unrelated. Results showed that relatedness judgments were made faster for word pairs that were semantically related than for unrelated word pairs. Critically, orthographic overlap on semantically unrelated word pairs induced a significant increase in response latencies. These findings indicate that orthographic information is involuntarily accessed in spoken-word recognition, even in a non-alphabetic language such as Chinese. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.3933333333333333

In Study 1, college students from the United States (N = 115), China (N = 106), and Japan (N = 99) made PSG decisions facing each other. This natural experiment revealed that Chinese and Japanese participants (a) made more preemptive attacks against each other and Americans than against their compatriots, and that (b) greater preexisting perceptions of bilateral competition increased intergroup attack rates. In Study 2, adult Americans (N = 127) watched real CNN expert interviews portraying United States-China economic interdependence as more positive or negative. This randomized experiment revealed that the more positive portrayal reduced preemptive American strikes against Chinese (but not Japanese), while the more negative portrayal amplified American anger about China's rise, increasing preemptive attacks against Chinese. We also found, however, that preemptive strikes were primarily defensive and not offensive.

However, due to technical limitations, previous workload studies have been unable to record brain activity via conventional electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) devices in mobile participants. In this study, we used a wearable EEG system to estimate workload while participants walked in a naturalistic environment. Specifically, we used the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) which is an oscillatory brain activity evoked by repetitive auditory stimuli, as an estimation index of workload. Participants performed three types of N-back tasks, which were expected to command different workloads, while walking at a constant speed. We used a binaural 500 Hz pure tone with amplitude modulation at 40 Hz to evoke the ASSR. We found that the phase-locking index (PLI) of ASSR activity was significantly correlated with the degree of task difficulty, even for EEG data from few electrodes. Thus, ASSR appears to be an effective indicator of workload during walking in an ecologically valid environment. © 2017 Yokota, Tanaka, Miyamoto and Naruse.",0.4166666666666667

The results support the idea that perceived parental responsiveness mediates the link between self-disclosure and relationship quality in the context of parent–child relationships. Dysfunctional independence predicts less self-disclosure, perceptions of less parental responsiveness, and poorer parent–child relationship quality. Significant gender differences were found on dysfunctional independence, self-disclosure, perceived parental responsiveness, and parent–child relationship quality.

For James Gibson, ""to perceive the world is to coperceive oneself."" If the sense of self is disturbed in individuals with schizophrenia, this could also lead to disturbances in these individuals' ability to perceive affordances, environmental properties taken with reference to the perceiver's action capabilities (e.g., a rigid surface affording 'walk-on-able,' chairs 'sit-on-able,' and so on). To test this hypothesis, three experiments investigated schizophrenia patients' affordance perception. Participants were presented with a photo of a common object on the computer and then asked to judge its secondary affordance (a non-designed function) in a two-choice reaction time task in Experiment 1 and in a yes/no task in Experiment 2. Schizophrenia participants performed less accurately and more slowly than controls. To rule out visual impairment as a contributing factor, in Experiment 3, participants identified physical properties (color, shape, material composition) of the objects. Schizophrenia participants were as accurate as controls and responded faster than in the previous experiments. Results suggest that the capacity to perceive affordances is likely impaired in people with schizophrenia, although the capacity to detect the object's physical properties is kept intact. Inability to perceive affordances, those functionally significant properties of the surrounding environment, may help explain why schizophrenia patients may appear as somewhat detached from the world. © 2017 Kim and Kim.",0.42081447963800905

Here we propose a switching adaptation model for performing bipedal locomotion by improving autonomous distributed control, where autonomous actuators interact without central control and switch the roles for propulsion, balancing, and leg swing. Our switching mobility model achieved direction change at any time using only three actuators, although it showed higher motor costs than comparable models without direction change. Our method of evaluating such adaptation at any time should be utilized as a prerequisite for understanding universal motor control.

Behavioral studies have suggested that gaze-triggered attentional orienting is intact in response to supraliminally presented eyes but impaired in response to subliminally presented eyes in individuals with ASD. However, the neural mechanisms underlying conscious and unconscious gaze-triggered attentional orienting remain unclear. We investigated this issue in ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. The participants viewed cue stimuli of averted or straight eye gaze direction presented either supraliminally or subliminally and then localized a target. Reaction times were shorter when eye-gaze cues were directionally valid compared with when they were neutral under the supraliminal condition in both groups; the same pattern was found in the TD group but not the ASD group under the subliminal condition. The temporo–parieto–frontal regions showed stronger activation in response to averted eyes than to straight eyes in both groups under the supraliminal condition. The left amygdala was more activated while viewing averted vs. straight eyes in the TD group than in the ASD group under the subliminal condition.

Although some brain regions have been found to be correlated with the semantic impairments of SD patients, it is unclear if the damage is actually responsible for SD patients’ semantic disorders because these findings were primarily obtained by examining the roles of local individual regions themselves without considering the influence of other regions that are functionally or structurally connected to the local individual regions. To resolve this problem, we investigated, from the brain network perspective, the relationship between the brain-network measures of regions and connections with semantic performance in 17 SD patients. We found that the severity of semantic deficits of SD patients was significantly correlated with the degree centrality values of the left anterior hippocampus (aHIP). Moreover, the semantic performance of the patients was also significantly correlated with the strength of gray matter functional connectivity of this region and two other regions: the left temporal pole/insula (TP/INS) and the left middle temporal gyrus. We further observed that the strength of the white matter structural connectivity of the left aHIP-left TP/INS tract could effectively predict the semantic performance of SD patients. When we controlled for a wide range of potential confounding factors (e.g., total gray matter volume), the above effects still held well. These findings revealed the critical brain network with the left aHIP as the center that could be contributing to the semantic impairments of SD. © 2017 Chen, Chen, Ding, Zhang, Yang, Lv, Guo and Han.",0.4342629482071713
Perceiving crowd attention: Gaze following in human crowds with conflicting cues,2017,27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014536604&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-017-1303-z&partnerID=40&md5=475267290872ab31b1921a18eece7082,"People automatically redirect their visual attention by following others’ gaze orientation, a phenomenon called “gaze following.” This is an evolutionarily generated socio-cognitive process that provides people with information about their environments. Often, however, people in crowds can have rather different gaze orientations. This study investigated how gaze following occurs in situations with many conflicting gazes. In two experiments, we modified the gaze cueing paradigm to use a crowd rather than a single individual. Specifically, participants were presented with a group of human avatars with differing gaze orientations, and the target appeared randomly on the left or right side of a display. We found that (a) when a marked difference existed in the number of avatars with divergent gaze orientations, participants automatically followed the majority’s gaze orientation, and (b) the strongest gaze cue effect occurred when all gazes shared the same orientation, with the response superiority of the majority’s oriented location monotonically diminishing with the number of gazes with divergent orientations. These findings suggested that the majority rule plays a role in gaze following behavior when individuals are confronted with conflicting multigaze scenes, and that an increasing subgroup size appears to enlarge the strength of the gaze cueing effect. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.40594059405940597

Inspired by previous theories and research on behavioral addiction, the Griffiths's widely accepted six-factor component model was referred to and an 18-item scale was constructed, with each component measured by three items. The results of exploratory factor analysis, based on Sample 1 (999 college students) and confirmatory factor analysis, based on Sample 2 (854 college students) showed the Griffiths's substantive six-factor structure underlay the online shopping addiction scale. Cronbach's alpha suggested that the resulting scale was highly reliable. Concurrent validity, based on Sample 3 (328 college students), was also satisfactory as indicated by correlations between the scale and measures of similar constructs. Finally, self-perceived online shopping addiction can be predicted to a relatively high degree. The present 18-item scale is a solid theory-based instrument to empirically measure online shopping addiction and can be used for understanding the phenomena among young adults. © 2017 Zhao, Tian and Xin.",0.47058823529411764
Perceptual individuation training (but Not Mere Exposure) reduces implicit racial bias in preschool children,2017,50,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018436405&doi=10.1037%2fdev0000290&partnerID=40&md5=bf06e6f56d974f31b95f4e68075fdb4b,"Two studies with preschool-age children examined the effectiveness of perceptual individuation training at reducing racial bias (Study 1, N = 32; Study 2, N = 56). We found that training preschool-age children to individuate other-race faces resulted in a reduction in implicit racial bias while mere exposure to other-race faces produced no such effect. We also showed that neither individuation training nor mere exposure reduced explicit racial bias. Theoretically, our findings provide strong evidence for a causal link between individual-level face processing and implicit racial bias, and are consistent with the newly proposed perceptual-social linkage hypothesis. Practically, our findings suggest that offering children experiences that allow them to increase their expertise in processing individual other-race faces will help reduce their implicit racial bias. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.5
Unraveling the linguistic nature of specific autobiographical memories using a computerized classification algorithm,2017,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976310807&doi=10.3758%2fs13428-016-0753-x&partnerID=40&md5=08505bf5ecddba2da4c96a35770ad90a,"In the present study, we explored the linguistic nature of specific memories generated with the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT) by developing a computerized classifier that distinguishes between specific and nonspecific memories. The AMT is regarded as one of the most important assessment tools to study memory dysfunctions (e.g., difficulty recalling the specific details of memories) in psychopathology. In Study 1, we utilized the Japanese corpus data of 12,400 cue-recalled memories tagged with observer-rated specificity. We extracted linguistic features of particular relevance to memory specificity, such as past tense, negation, and adverbial words and phrases pertaining to time and location. On the basis of these features, a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to classify the memories into specific and nonspecific categories, which achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of.92 in a performance test. In Study 2, the trained SVM was tested in terms of its robustness in classifying novel memories (n = 8,478) that were retrieved in response to cue words that were different from those used in Study 1. The SVM showed an AUC of.89 in classifying the new memories. In Study 3, we extended the binary SVM to a five-class classification of the AMT, which achieved 64%–65% classification accuracy, against the chance level (20%) in the performance tests. Our data suggest that memory specificity can be identified with a relatively small number of words, capturing the universal linguistic features of memory specificity across memories in diverse contents. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4700854700854701
Spontaneous facial actions map onto emotional experiences in a non-social context: Toward a component-based approach,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019648853&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00633&partnerID=40&md5=f747a5cca876307518a17b0bf5258e78,"While numerous studies have examined the relationships between facial actions and emotions, they have yet to account for the ways that specific spontaneous facial expressions map onto emotional experiences induced without expressive intent. Moreover, previous studies emphasized that a fine-grained investigation of facial components could establish the coherence of facial actions with actual internal states. Therefore, this study aimed to accumulate evidence for the correspondence between spontaneous facial components and emotional experiences. We reinvestigated data from previous research which secretly recorded spontaneous facial expressions of Japanese participants as they watched film clips designed to evoke four different target emotions: surprise, amusement, disgust, and sadness. The participants rated their emotional experiences via a self-reported questionnaire of 16 emotions. These spontaneous facial expressions were coded using the Facial Action Coding System, the gold standard for classifying visible facial movements. We corroborated each facial action that was present in the emotional experiences by applying stepwise regression models. The results found that spontaneous facial components occurred in ways that cohere to their evolutionary functions based on the rating values of emotional experiences (e.g., the inner brow raiser might be involved in the evaluation of novelty). This study provided new empirical evidence for the correspondence between each spontaneous facial component and first-person internal states of emotion as reported by the expresser. © 2017 Namba, Kabir, Miyatani and Nakao.",0.5045454545454545
Increased gamma connectivity in the human prefrontal cortex during the bereitschaftspotential,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018863376&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00180&partnerID=40&md5=293bcaecc80c9e096d7ef071db00ca21,"The Bereitschaftspotential (BP) is a slow negative cortical potential preceding voluntary movement. Since movement preparation is dependent upon the synchronous activity of a variety of neurons, BP may develop through the exchange of information among motor-related neurons. However, the relationship between BP and information flow is not yet well-known. In the present study, we aimed to investigate howthe connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) changes during the occurrence of BP. Electrocorticography (ECoG) was recorded in five patients with epilepsy. The subjects performed self-paced hand grasping. We compared the intraregional connectivity between PFC and non-PFC regions using partial directed coherence. In the PFC, the connectivity of beta and gamma bands in the BP period increased by an average of 24.4% compared with the baseline connectivity. Conversely, gamma connectivity in non-PFC regions decreased by 31.4%. Moreover, the intraregional connectivity in the PFC increased according to the stage of BP. The increased gamma band connectivity in the PFC implies that the increased communication among neurons in the PFC is associated with development of BP. Intraregional connectivity as one of the factors involved in voluntary movement may reflect the activation of brain networks related to movement preparation in PFC. © 2017 Kim, Kim and Chung.",0.3553299492385787
An Extension of a Parallel-Distributed Processing Framework of Reading Aloud in Japanese: Human Nonword Reading Accuracy Does Not Require a Sequential Mechanism,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978138143&doi=10.1111%2fcogs.12382&partnerID=40&md5=25e89336a66ef546ca863a7066a5ef8a,"Humans can pronounce a nonword (e.g., rint). Some researchers have interpreted this behavior as requiring a sequential mechanism by which a grapheme-phoneme correspondence rule is applied to each grapheme in turn. However, several parallel-distributed processing (PDP) models in English have simulated human nonword reading accuracy without a sequential mechanism. Interestingly, the Japanese psycholinguistic literature went partly in the same direction, but it has since concluded that a sequential parsing mechanism is required to reproduce human nonword reading accuracy. In this study, by manipulating the list composition (i.e., pure word/nonword list vs. mixed list), we demonstrated that past psycholinguistic studies in Japanese have overestimated human nonword reading accuracy. When the more fairly reevaluated human performance was targeted, a newly implemented Japanese PDP model simulated the target accuracy as well as the error patterns. These findings suggest that PDP models are a more parsimonious way of explaining reading across various languages. Copyright © 2016 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.",0.37662337662337664

However, the IOR of emergency managerial experts is unknown. By employing emergency and natural scene pictures in expert-novice paradigm, the present study explored the neural activity underlying the IOR effects for emergency managerial experts and novices. In behavioral results, there were no differences of IOR effects between novices and emergency managerial experts, while the event-related potentials (ERPs) results were different between novices and experts. In Experiment 1 (novice group), ERPs results showed no any IOR was robust at both stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) of 200 ms and 400 ms. In Experiment 2 (expert group), ERPs results showed an enhanced N2 at SOA of 200 ms and attenuated P3 at cued location in the right parietal lobe and adjacent brain regions than uncued location at SOA of 200 ms. The findings of the two experiments showed that, relative to the novices, IOR for the emergency managerial experts was robust, and dominated in the right parietal lobe and adjacent brain regions, suggesting more flexible attentional processing and higher visual search efficiency of the emergency managerial experts. The findings indicate that the P3, possible N2, over the right parietal lobe and adjacent brain regions are the biological indicators for IOR elicited by post-cued emergency pictures for emergency managerial experts. © 2017 Cao, Wu and Wang.",0.49295774647887325

During comprehension, however, it remains unclear how the brain encodes the relationship between words and combines them into phrases. One hypothesis is that internal grammatical principles governing language generation are also used to parse the hierarchical syntactic structure of spoken language. An alternative hypothesis suggests, in contrast, that decoding language during comprehension solely relies on statistical relationships between words or strings of words, that is, the N-gram statistics, and no hierarchical linguistic structures are constructed. Here, we briefly review distinctions between rule-based hierarchical models and statistics-based linear string models for comprehension. Recent neurolinguistic studies show that tracking of probabilistic relationships between words is not sufficient to explain cortical encoding of linguistic constituent structure and support the involvement of rule-based processing during language comprehension. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.46794871794871795
Further Tests of a Dynamic-Adjustment Account of Saccade Targeting During the Reading of Chinese,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014903153&doi=10.1111%2fcogs.12487&partnerID=40&md5=350bf06055829b227c182707e3515668,"There are two accounts of how readers of unspaced writing systems (e.g., Chinese) know where to move their eyes: (a) saccades are directed toward default targets (e.g., centers of words that have been segmented in the parafovea); or (b) saccade lengths are adjusted dynamically, as a function of ongoing parafoveal processing. This article reports an eye-movement experiment supporting the latter hypothesis by demonstrating that the slope of the relationship between the saccade launch site on word N and the subsequent fixation landing site on word N + 1 is > 1, suggesting that saccades are lengthened from launch sites that afford more parafoveal processing. This conclusion is then evaluated and confirmed via simulations using implementations of both hypotheses (Liu, Reichle, & Li, 2016), with a discussion of these results for our understanding of saccadic targeting during reading and existing models of eye-movement control.

Two groups of 20 probable mild AD patients and 19 healthy older adults were included in a cross-sectional analysis. All subjects took an object-location memory task. EEG recordings performed during object-location memory tasks were compared between the two groups in the two EEG parameters (spectral parameters and phase synchronization).

The channels-pairs the phase lag index value of object-location memory in the AD group was clearly higher than the NC group in the delta, theta, and alpha bands in encoding sessions and delta and theta bands in retrieval sessions.

Is the bias for function-based explanations culturally universal?

For instance, in contrast to Western adults, they explicitly endorse the idea that mountains were created for climbing, just like hats were created for warmth. Is this bias a product of culture or a product of universal aspects of human cognition? In two studies, we explored whether adults and children in Mainland China, a highly secular, non-Western culture, show a bias for teleological explanations. When explaining both object properties (Experiment 1) and origins (Experiment 2), we found evidence that they do. Whereas Chinese adults restricted teleological explanations to scientifically warranted cases, Chinese children endorsed them more broadly, extending them across different kinds of natural phenomena. This bias decreased with rising grade level across first, second, and fourth grades. Overall, these data provide evidence that children's bias for teleological explanations is not solely a product of Western Abrahamic cultures. Instead, it extends to other cultures, including the East Asian secular culture of modern-day China. This suggests that the bias for function-based explanations may be driven by universal aspects of human cognition. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.49206349206349204
Attentional capture to a singleton distractor degrades visual marking in visual search,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019562118&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00801&partnerID=40&md5=1e5fea7715a0a84da644989368030029,"Visual search is easier after observing some distractors in advance; it is as if the previewed distractors were excluded from the search. This effect is referred to as the preview benefit, and a memory template that visually marks the old locations of the distractors is thought to help in prioritizing the locations of newly presented items. One remaining question is whether the presence of a conspicuous item during the sequential shift of attention within the new items reduces this preview benefit. To address this issue, we combined the above preview search and a conventional visual search paradigm using a singleton distractor and examined whether the search performance was affected by the presence of the singleton. The results showed that the slope of reaction time as a function of set size became steeper in the presence of a singleton, indicating that the singleton distractor reduced the preview benefit. Furthermore, this degradation effect was positively correlated with the degree of conventional attentional capture to a singleton measured in a separate experiment with simultaneous search. These findings suggest that the mechanism of visual marking shares common attentional resources with the search process. © 2017 Yamauchi, Osugi and Murakami.",0.37305699481865284

These disorders can be grouped in fear and distress disorders. Aim of this study was to study the association between fear and distress disorders with subsequent heart disease, taking into account the temporal order of disorders. Methods Twenty household surveys were conducted in 18 countries (n= 53791; person years= 2,212,430). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed lifetime prevalence and age at onset of disorders, and respondents were categorized into categories based on the presence and timing of fear and distress disorders. Heart disease was indicated by self-report of physician-diagnosed heart disease or self-report of heart attack, together with year of onset. Survival analyses estimated associations between disorder categories and heart disease. Results Most respondents with fear or distress disorders had either pure distress or pure fear (8.5% and 7.7% of total sample), while fear preceded distress in the large majority of respondents with comorbid fear and distress (3.8% of total sample). Compared to the “no fear or distress disorder” category, respondents with pure fear disorder had the highest odds of subsequent heart disease (OR:1.8; 95%CI:1.5–2.2; p < 0.001) and compared to respondents with pure distress disorder, these respondents were at a significantly increased risk of heart disease (OR:1.3; 95%CI:1.0–1.6; p= 0.020). Conclusion This novel analytic approach indicates that the risk of subsequent self-reported heart disease associated with pure fear disorder is significantly larger than the risk associated with distress disorder. These results should be confirmed in prospective studies using objective measures of heart disease. © 2017",0.5219123505976095

Mothers reported on psychological control. Children's cortisol was collected during a stressor and two indices of Area Under the Curve (AUC) were computed: AUCg which accounts for total output, and AUCi, which captures reactivity. Results indicate that Chinese mothers reported higher levels of psychological control and Chinese children had higher levels of AUCg than their American counterparts. Across both cultures, psychological control was significantly associated with increased cortisol levels as indexed by AUCg. There were no associations for AUCi. Finally, mediation analyses demonstrated that psychological control fully explained cultural differences in children's cortisol stress response as indexed by AUCg. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",0.4936708860759494

Identifying risk factors that contribute to HIV-risk behaviors will help to curb the rapid HIV transmission among this group. Our hypothesis was that MSM with substance use were more likely to conduct HIV-risk behaviors, even after accounting for repeated measures. In the current study, we employed a cohort study design by following a group of 367 HIV-positive MSM up to four visits for one year to collect information regarding their sexual behaviors and history of substance use in the past three months. We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models to account both within- and between-subject variation when assessing associations between substance use and HIV-risk behaviors. A total of 367 MSM were included at the baseline with a mean age of 29.6 years. After accounting for potential confounders and time-varying effects, our models indicated that drug and alcohol use increase HIV risks at the population level by increasing risks of drinking alcohol before sex, having unprotected sex with men and seropositive partners, having more lifetime female sex partners and having a higher number of male sexual partners in the past three months. The current study is one of the first studies with repeated measures to evaluate the association between substance use and sexual risk behaviors among MSM in China. Findings in the current study have several implications for future research. We call for more rigorous study design for future research to better capture changes of risky behaviors among this at-risk population. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.4681647940074906

We tested this assumption by recording ERPs while native Chinese speakers read short texts for comprehension in the word-to-text integration (WTI) paradigm to compare with studies of English using this paradigm. Of interest was the ERP on a 2-character word that began the second sentence of the text, with the first sentence varied to manipulate co-reference with the critical word in the second sentence. A paraphrase condition in which the critical word meaning was coreferential with a word in the first sentence showed a reduced N400 reduction. Consistent with results in English, this N400 effect suggests immediate integration of a Chinese 2-character word with the meaning of the text. Chinese allows an additional test of a morpheme effect when one character of a two-character word is repeated across the sentence boundary, thus having both orthographic and meaning overlap. This shared morpheme condition showed no effect during the timeframe when orthographic effects are observed (e.g. N200), nor did it show an N400 effect. However, character repetition did produce an N400 reduction on parietal sites regardless it represented the same morpheme or a different one. The results indicate that the WTI integration effect is general across writing systems at the meaning level, but that the orthographic form nonetheless has an effect, and is specifically functional in Chinese reading. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0.4083333333333333

However, this argument may miss an important fact: A bias-corrected estimate can take a negative value, and of course, a negative variance ratio does not make sense. Therefore, it has been a common practice to report an obtained negative estimate as zero. This article presents an argument against this practice, based on a simulation study investigating how often negative estimates are obtained and what are the consequences of treating them as zero. The results indicate that negative estimates are obtained more often than researchers might have thought. In fact, they occur more than half the time under some reasonable conditions. Moreover, treating the obtained negative estimates as zero causes substantial overestimation of even bias-corrected estimators when the sample size and population effect are not large, which is often the case in psychology. Therefore, the recommendation is that researchers report obtained negative estimates as is, instead of reporting them as zero, to avoid the inflation of effect sizes in research syntheses, even though zero can be considered the most plausible value when interpreting such a result.

Thought control ability is different from rumination in explaining the association between neuroticism and depression: A three-study replication,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021335184&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00838&partnerID=40&md5=100b26a3fb2272a03fb673ba4af1a7ff,"Neuroticism is the most common vulnerability factor of depression. However, the mechanism underlying this vulnerability is still unclear. Previous studies suggested that rumination intensifies the negative effect of neuroticism on depression. However, whether cognitive control could explain the association between neuroticism and depression remains unclear to date. Therefore, this study evaluated the indirect effects of rumination and thought control on the relationship between neuroticism and depression. Seven self-report measures were employed among healthy and main depression disorder (MDD) participants. Three studies were used to examine the hypotheses. Results of the three studies showed significant correlations among neuroticism, rumination, thought control, and depression. Rumination mediated the link between neuroticism and depression among healthy young adults, and this finding replicated previous studies. This study provided new evidence that thought control mediates the association between neuroticism and depression in both healthy and MDD populations. In conclusion, rumination increases neuroticism risk for depression, but high-level thought control decreases the effect of neuroticism on depression. This study may serve as a reference to develop effective and focused interventions for MDD patients. © 2017 Lu, Yang, Zhang and Qiu.",0.5138121546961326
The relationship between authoritarian leadership and employees' deviant workplace behaviors: The mediating effects of psychological contract violation and organizational cynicism,2017,64,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019646272&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00732&partnerID=40&md5=e78f54edebaf48b89c23cbfc5f496769,"This study investigated the relationship between authoritarian leadership and employees' deviant workplace behaviors (DWB), as well as the mediating effects of psychological contract violation and organizational cynicism. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 391 manufacturing workers in a northern city of China. Structural equation modeling was performed to test the theory-driven models. The results showed that the relationship between authoritarian leadership and employees' DWB was mediated by organizational cynicism. Moreover, this relationship was also sequentially mediated by psychological contract violation and organizational cynicism. This research unveiled psychological contract violation and organizational cynicism as underlying mechanism that explained the link between authoritarian leadership and employees' DWB. © 2017 Jiang, Chen, Sun and Yang.",0.44036697247706424
Rapid weight gain during infancy and early childhood is related to higher anthropometric measurements in preadolescence,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015327255&doi=10.1111%2fcch.12455&partnerID=40&md5=4b8c408a745fd994e3ffa21b42c19eb2,"Background: This study examined the relationship between rapid weight gain during infancy and/or early childhood and anthropometric measurements [body mass index (BMI), percent body fat (%BF), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)] in preadolescence by sex. Methods: Subjects were fourth-grade school children (aged 9 to 10 years) from elementary schools in Ina-town, Japan, in 2010. Measurements of height, weight, %BF and WC were conducted for each subject. We obtained data on height and weight of subjects at birth, age 1.5 years and age 3 years from the Maternal and Child Health handbook. Rapid weight gain was defined as a change in weight-for-age standard deviation score greater than 0.67 from birth to age 1.5 years (infancy) or from age 1.5 to 3 years (early childhood). Results: All anthropometric variables (BMI, %BF, WC and WHtR) at age 9 to 10 years were significantly higher in the rapid weight gain during both infancy and early childhood period group than in the no rapid weight gain group, regardless of sex. When compared with the no rapid weight gain group, rapid weight gain during early childhood period had significantly higher BMI and WC in boys and BMI, %BF and WC in girls. Compared with the no rapid weight gain group, the rapid weight gain during infancy group had a significantly higher WC in boys and significantly higher BMI and WC in girls. Conclusion: Rapid weight gain during both infancy and early childhood was related to higher anthropometric measurements, including WHtR, among Japanese preadolescents, regardless of sex. This study suggests that rapid weight gain during infancy and early childhood may be a risk factor for general/abdominal obesity later in life. © 2017 The Authors.

This study compared the maximum likelihood (ML) selection model based on missing at random (MAR) mechanism and the Diggle-Kenward selection model based on MNAR mechanism for handling missing data through a Monte Carlo simulation study. Four factors were considered, including the missingness mechanism, the dropout rate, the distribution shape (i.e., skewness and kurtosis), and the sample size. The results indicated that: (1) Under the MAR mechanism, the Diggle-Kenward selection model yielded similar estimation results with the ML approach; Under the MNAR mechanism, the results of ML approach were underestimated, especially for the intercept mean and intercept slope (μi and μs). (2) Under the MAR mechanism, the 95% CP of the Diggle-Kenward selection model was lower than that of the ML method; Under the MNAR mechanism, the 95% CP for the two methods were both under the desired level of 95%, but the Diggle-Kenward selection model yielded much higher coverage probabilities than the ML method. (3) The Diggle-Kenward selection model was easier to be influenced by the non-normal degree of target variable's distribution than the ML approach. The level of dropout rate was the major factor affecting the parameter estimation precision, and the dropout rate-induced difference of two methods can be ignored only when the dropout rate falls below 10%. © 2017 Li, Chen, Cui and Liu.",0.4663677130044843

Under this policy, a growing number of youths have gained access to higher education, which aims to train students to be more rational. This study examines human rationality at a Chinese college through an experiment based on the risky-choice framing effect. The basic results show no classical framing effect with regard to individual decisions for the entire sample in a benchmark setting. However, when the participants' roles were manipulated and subsamples were investigated, a significant framing effect was found that appeared to be role-related and that varied by sex. These results help to elucidate evaluations of the effects of China's higher education policy and may assist in guiding further policy reforms. © 2017 Fan.",0.48
How doctors communicate the initial diagnosis of cancer matters: Cancer disclosure and its relationship with patients’ hope and trust,2017,40,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85024105935&doi=10.1002%2fpon.4063&partnerID=40&md5=80c87c6f80dea390c0d4d80453176d50,"Objective: The study is to examine the relationships between perceived initial cancer disclosure communication with doctors, levels of hope, and levels of trust in doctors among cancer patients in China. Methods: A total number of 192 cancer inpatients in a cancer hospital in China were surveyed. Perceived disclosure strategies, levels of hope, levels of trust in their doctors, as well as the demographic information were obtained from the participants. Results: In addition to age, patients who had higher levels of perceived emotional support from doctors, or higher levels of perceived personalized disclosure from doctors, or higher levels of perceived discussion of multiple treatment plans with doctors were more likely to have higher levels of trust in doctors. In addition to perceived health status, perceived emotional support from doctors significantly predicted participants’ levels of hope. That is, patients who had higher higher levels of perceived doctors’ emotional support were more likely to have higher levels of hope. Key disclosure person was a marginally significant variable, that is, patients who were mainly disclosed by family members might have higher levels of hope compared with patients who were mainly disclosed by doctors. Conclusions: When communicating with a cancer patient, doctors might not ignore the importance of emotional support during cancer diagnosis communication. Doctors might want to involve family and collaborate with family to find out ways of personalized disclosure. During the communication process, doctors could provide their patients with multiple treatment options and discuss the benefits and side effects of each treatment. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0.42857142857142855
Long-time exposure to violent video games does not show desensitization on empathy for pain: An fMRI Study,2017,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019595415&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00650&partnerID=40&md5=3961d8bfa0a5bd4671932c13cb8fe02d,"As a typical form of empathy, empathy for pain refers to the perception and appraisal of others' pain, as well as the corresponding affective responses. Numerous studies investigated the factors affecting the empathy for pain, in which the exposure to violent video games (VVGs) could change players' empathic responses to painful situations. However, it remains unclear whether exposure to VVG influences the empathy for pain. In the present study, in terms of the exposure experience to VVG, two groups of participants (18 in VVG group, VG; 17 in non-VVG group, NG) were screened from nearly 200 video game experience questionnaires. And then, the functional magnetic resonance imaging data were recorded when they were viewing painful and non-painful stimuli. The results showed that the perception of others' pain were not significantly different in brain regions between groups, from which we could infer that the desensitization effect of VVGs was overrated. © 2017 Gao, Pan, Li, Weng, Yao and Chen.",0.40522875816993464
Pain threshold reflects psychological traits in patients with chronic pain: A cross-sectional study,2017,15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018934158&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0098-4&partnerID=40&md5=76b8f1e60103fb84bbc70fb9a8961c30,"Background: Chronic pain enhances sensory sensitivity and induces the biased development of psychological traits such as depression and pain catastrophizing, leading to the formation of heterogeneous conditions. Fluctuations in the sensory-related thresholds of non-injured sites (with normal peripheral tissue) in patients with chronic pain are thought to be related to central sensitization. The objectives of this study were to analyze the association between pain tolerance thresholds (PTTs) in non-injured sites and the psychological traits of patients with chronic pain and to evaluate the usefulness of PTT measures in assessments of pathological conditions related to chronic pain. Methods: This study included 57 patients with chronic pain. The PTTs were measured in non-injured sites with quantitative sensory testing (QST) with electrical stimulation and then classified with cluster analysis. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire was used to subjectively assess pain in the injured sites. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was used to assess the patients' psychological traits. Results: Based on the cluster analysis of PTTs, the patients were classified into a High-Sensitivity group and an Others group consisting of the remaining patients. The results of the MMPI profiles showed that the High-Sensitivity group included significantly more patients with the Neurotic Triad pattern and no patients with the Conversion V pattern. The scores of the hypochondriasis and hysteria scales were significantly lower in the High-Sensitivity group than in the Others group. Conclusions: This study indicated that patients with chronic pain can be classified according to PTTs in non-injured sites and suggests that patients with High-Sensitivity have characteristic psychological traits. Assessment of PTTs in non-injured sites would be useful for evaluating the psychological condition of patients with chronic pain. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.39855072463768115
Motivation counts: Autonomous but not obligated sharing promotes happiness in preschoolers,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021313385&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00867&partnerID=40&md5=701cf5380b20f4aed03c8b44653de2e7,"Research has demonstrated that prosocial sharing is emotionally rewarding, which leads to further prosocial actions; such a positive feedback loop suggests a proximal mechanism of human's tendency to act prosocially. However, it leaves open a question as to how the emotional benefits from sharing develop in young children and whether sharing under pressure promotes happiness as well. The current study directly compared 3- and 5-year-old Chinese children's happiness when sharing was autonomous (the recipient did not contribute to getting the reward) with when sharing was obligated (the recipient and the actor jointly earned the reward). We found that children shared more items overall when sharing was obligated than autonomous, demonstrating their conformity to social norms of merit-based sharing. In children who eventually shared with others, 5-year-olds gave out more stickers in the obligated sharing condition than in the autonomous sharing condition, but 3-year-olds shared the same amount between the conditions, suggesting that 5-year-olds adhered to the merit-based sharing norm more strictly than 3-year-olds. Moreover, in the autonomous sharing condition, children displayed greater happiness when they shared with the recipient than when they kept stickers for themselves, suggesting that costly prosocial giving benefited children with positive mood; however, children did not gain happiness when they shared with the recipient in the obligated sharing condition. These findings demonstrate that children's affective benefits depend on the motivation underlying their prosocial behavior, and further imply that normative force and emotional gains may independently drive preschoolers' prosocial behaviors. © 2017 Wu, Zhang, Guo and Gros-Louis.",0.3724696356275304
Dissociating effects of scrambling and topicalization within the left frontal and temporal language areas: An fMRI study in Kaqchikel Maya,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019650872&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00748&partnerID=40&md5=03d34870e6f4c75a09ad9182e8b1a5a3,"Some natural languages grammatically allow different types of changing word orders, such as object scrambling and topicalization. Scrambling and topicalization are more related to syntax and semantics/phonology, respectively. Here we hypothesized that scrambling should activate the left frontal regions, while topicalization would affect the bilateral temporal regions. To examine such distinct effects in our functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we targeted the Kaqchikel Maya language, a Mayan language spoken in Guatemala. In Kaqchikel, the syntactically canonical word order is verb-object-subject (VOS), but at least three non-canonical word orders (i.e., SVO, VSO, and OVS) are also grammatically allowed. We used a sentence-picture matching task, in which the participants listened to a short Kaqchikel sentence and judged whether a picture matched the meaning of the sentence. The advantage of applying this experimental paradigm to an understudied language such as Kaqchikel is that it will allow us to validate the universality of linguistic computation in the brain. We found that the conditions with scrambled sentences [+scrambling] elicited significant activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus and lateral premotor cortex, both of which have been proposed as grammar centers, indicating the effects of syntactic loads. In contrast, the conditions without topicalization [-topicalization] resulted in significant activation in bilateral Heschl's gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, demonstrating that the syntactic and phonological processes were clearly dissociated within the language areas. Moreover, the pre-supplementary motor area and left superior/middle temporal gyri were activated under relatively demanding conditions, suggesting their supportive roles in syntactic or semantic processing. To exclude any semantic/phonological effects of the object-subject word orders, we performed direct comparisons while making the factor of topicalization constant, and observed localized activations in the left inferior frontal gyrus and lateral premotor cortex. These results establish that the types of scrambling and topicalization have different impacts on the specified language areas. These findings further indicate that the functional roles of these left frontal and temporal regions involve linguistic aspects themselves, namely syntax versus semantics/phonology, rather than output/input aspects of speech processing. © 2017 Ohta, Koizumi and Sakai.",0.4494047619047619
General and food-specific inhibitory control as moderators of the effects of the impulsive systems on food choices,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019613363&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00802&partnerID=40&md5=ac8e8bab64eed47b3f727880f4251dbc,"The present study aimed to extend the application of the reflective-impulsive model to restrained eating and explore the effect of automatic attention (impulsive system) on food choices. Furthermore, we examined the moderating effects of general inhibitory control (G-IC) and food-specific inhibitory control (F-IC) on successful and unsuccessful restrained eaters (US-REs). Automatic attention was measured using ""the EyeLink 1000,"" which tracked eye movements during the process of making food choices, and G-IC and F-IC were measured using the Stop-Signal Task. The results showed that food choices were related to automatic attention and that G-IC and F-IC moderated the predictive relationship between automatic attention and food choices. Furthermore, among successful restrained eaters (S-REs), automatic attention to high caloric foods did not predict food choices, regardless of whether G-IC or F-IC was high or low. Whereas food choice was positively correlated with automatic attention among US-REs with poor F-IC, this pattern was not observed in those with poor G-IC. In conclusion, the S-REs had more effective self-management skills and their food choices were affected less by automatic attention and inhibitory control. Unsuccessful restrained eating was associated with poor F-IC (not G-IC) and greater automatic attention to high caloric foods. Thus, clinical interventions should focus on enhancing F-IC, not G-IC, and on reducing automatic attention to high caloric foods. © 2017 Zhang, Chen, Chen, Gu and Xu.",0.4772727272727273

Extant research focuses on frontostriatal mechanisms of impulsivity and how executive functions are compromised in impulsive individuals. Imaging studies employing voxel based morphometry highlighted impulsivity-related changes in gray matter concentrations in a wide array of cerebral structures. In particular, whereas prefrontal cortical areas appear to show structural alterations in individuals with a neuropsychiatric condition, the findings are less than consistent in the healthy population. Here, in a sample (n = 113) of young adults assessed for Barratt impulsivity, we controlled for age, gender and alcohol use, and showed that higher impulsivity score is associated with increased gray matter volume (GMV) in bilateral medial parietal and occipital cortices known to represent the peripheral visual field. When impulsivity components were assessed, we observed that this increase in parieto-occipital cortical volume is correlated with inattention and non-planning but not motor subscore. In a separate behavioral experiment of 10 young adults, we demonstrated that impulsive individuals are more vulnerable to the influence of a distractor on target detection in an attention task. If replicated, these findings together suggest aberrant visual attention as a neural correlate of an impulsive personality trait in neurotypical individuals and need to be reconciled with the literature that focuses on frontal dysfunctions. © 2017 Ide, Tung, Yang, Tseng and Li.",0.4413145539906103

In our eye-tracking study, we introduced a new protocol, and studied the time-course of attention to test-related pictures with varying threat levels in 22 high test-anxious (HTA) and 22 low test-anxious (LTA) subjects. To determine whether attentional bias to test-related pictures is due to test-anxiety and not to state-anxiety, we also included a third group of 22 subjects with high state-anxiety but low test-anxiety (HSA). The subjects completed a free viewing task (FVT) in which high threat-neutral (HT-N) and low threat-neutral (LT-N) picture pairs were presented for 3 s. The results demonstrated that: (1) HTA subjects showed initial orienting to LT pictures, early attentional engagement with HT pictures later on and avoidance of HT pictures at the very end; (2) LTA subjects showed initial orienting to HT pictures and maintenance of attention on them later on; while (3) HSA subjects showed an initial orientation towards LT pictures and maintenance of attention on LT and HT pictures later on. These results suggest that, (high) test-anxiety is also prone to attentional bias towards test-related threat stimuli.

Structural equation modeling revealed that upward social comparison and self-esteem mediated the relationship between SNS usage and users' subjective well-being. We found that social comparison orientation moderated the association between passive SNS usage and users' upward social comparison. Specifically, social comparison orientation strengthened the association between passive SNS usage and upward social comparison. The results might suggest a process through which passive SNS usage is related to subjective well-being, and identify a context under which these associations may differ. © 2017 Wang, Wang, Gaskin and Hawk.",0.5398773006134969

Cross-cultural researchers use SWLS to compare mean scores of life satisfaction across countries. Despite the wide use of SWLS in cross-cultural studies, measurement invariance of SWLS has rarely been investigated, and previous studies showed inconsistent findings. Therefore, we examined the measurement invariance of SWLS with samples collected from 26 countries. To test measurement invariance, we utilized three measurement invariance techniques: (a) multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA), (b) multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (ML-CFA), and (c) alignment optimization methods. The three methods demonstrated that configural and metric invariances of life satisfaction held across 26 countries, whereas scalar invariance did not. With partial invariance testing, we identified that the intercepts of Items 2, 4, and 5 were noninvariant. Based on two invariant intercepts, factor means of countries were compared. Chile showed the highest factor mean; Spain and Bulgaria showed the lowest. The findings enhance our understanding of life satisfaction across countries, and they provide researchers and practitioners with practical guidance on how to conduct measurement invariance testing across countries. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4715909090909091

An experimental investigation was conducted in which human participants interacted with a humanoid robot whose facial expression was shown on an LCD monitor that was mounted as its head (Study 1). Participants were asked to play the ultimatum game, which is usually used to measure human altruistic behavior. All participants were assigned to be the proposer and were instructed to decide their offer within 1 min by controlling a slider bar. The corners of the robot's mouth, as indicated by the line drawing, simply moved upward, or downward depending on the position of the slider bar. The results suggest that the change in the facial expression depicted by a simple line drawing of a face significantly affected the participant's final offer in the ultimatum game. The offers were increased by 13% when subjects were shown contingent changes of facial expression. The results were compared with an experiment in a teleoperation setting in which participants interacted with another person through a computer display showing the same line drawings used in Study 1 (Study 2).

Subjectivity of the anomalous sense of self is represented in gray matter volume in the brain,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018892382&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00232&partnerID=40&md5=2cb4fc1e5203a3ec4981c6ea72bdb5b1,"The self includes complicated and heterogeneous functions. Researchers have divided the self into three distinct functions called “agency,” “ownership,” and “narrative self”. These correspond to psychiatric symptoms, behavioral characteristics and neural responses, but their relationship with brain structure is unclear. This study examined the relationship between the subjectivity of self-related malfunctions and brain structure in terms of gray matter (GM) volume in 96 healthy people. They completed a recently developed self-reported questionnaire called the Embodied Sense of Self Scale (ESSS) that measures self-related malfunctions. The ESSS has three subscales reflecting the three distinct functions of the self. We also determined the participants’ brain structures using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between ownership malfunction and the insular cortex GM volume. A relationship with brain structure could thus only be confirmed for the ESSS “ownership” subscale. This finding suggests that distinct brain structures feel ownership and that the ESSS could partly screen for distinct brain structures. © 2017 Kanayama, Asai, Nakao, Makita, Kozuma, Uyama, Yamane, Kadota and Yamawaki.",0.39655172413793105
The effects of objective and subjective socioeconomic status on subjective well-being among rural-to-urban migrants in China: The moderating role of subjective social mobility,2017,76,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019939721&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00819&partnerID=40&md5=5c5494831bd51d27b62dd7e0fdcfd457,"Although previous investigations have agreed that Chinese rural-to-urban migrants' socioeconomic status (SES) increases with their migration, the association between SES and subjective well-being is uncertain. To address this research gap, the present study proposed that the association between objective SES and subjective well-being is mediated by subjective SES. This model was tested with a sample of 432 Chinese rural-to-urban migrants. The results indicate a significant association between objective SES and subjective well-being and a partial mediating effect of subjective SES. Furthermore, subjective social mobility, which is one's expectation about the possibility to move upward in the social hierarchy, was found to moderate both the direct path from objective SES to subjective well-being and the indirect path from subjective SES to subjective well-being. These findings suggest that Chinese rural-to-urban migrants gained in subjective well-being not only because of direct financial achievement but also because of their perceptions and beliefs about their relative social status. © 2017 Huang, Hou, Sun, Dou, Liu and Zhang.",0.39622641509433965

Resilience is known to be a protective factor for mental health problems but is not studied among MMT clients in China. This study aimed to explore the relationship between resilience and mental health problems (depression, anxiety and stress) among clients of community-based MMT clinics in China. A total of 208 MMT clients completed the face-to-face interview conducted at 4 of 11 MMT clinics in Guangzhou. The Chinese short version of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to assess the presence of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, and the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to measure resilience. Logistic regression models were fit in data analyses. Of all participants, 12.8%, 19.5% and 8.3% had depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. The mean resilience score was 57.6 (SD = 15.9). In the univariate analyses, resilience was negatively associated with two studied mental health problems (depression and anxiety, ORu = 0.96 and 0.96, p <.01). In multivariate models adjusting for both background and other psycho-social factors, resilience was independently associated with probable depression (ORa = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93–0.99) and anxiety (ORa = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94–0.99). Resilience was independently associated with depression and anxiety. As resilience is changeable, interventions targeting mental health problems of MMT users should consider resilience as an important part in the designing of such interventions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.5127118644067796
Perceived insider status and feedback reactions: A dual path of feedback motivation attribution,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019569934&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00668&partnerID=40&md5=127b6c57ab32c840685d303e9db5e42b,"Many studies have evaluated how the characteristics of feedback receiver, feedback deliverer and feedback information influence psychological feedback reactions of the feedback receiver while largely neglecting that feedback intervention is a kind of social interaction process. To address this issue, this study proposes that employees' perceived insider status (PIS), as a kind of employee-organization relationship, could also influence employees' reactions to supervisory feedback. In particular, this study investigates the influence of PIS focusing on affective and cognitive feedback reactions, namely feedback satisfaction and feedback utility. Surveys were conducted in a machinery manufacturing company in the Guangdong province of China. Samples were collected from 192 employees. Data analysis demonstrated that PIS and feedback utility possessed a U-shaped relationship, whereas PIS and feedback satisfaction exhibited positively linear relationships. The analysis identified two kinds of mediating mechanisms related to feedback satisfaction and feedback utility. Internal feedback motivation attribution partially mediated the relationship between PIS and feedback satisfaction but failed to do the same with respect to the relationship between PIS and feedback utility. In contrast, external feedback motivation attribution partially mediated the relationship between PIS and feedback utility while failing to mediate the relationship between PIS and feedback satisfaction. Theoretical contributions and practical implications of the findings are discussed at the end of the paper. © 2017 Chen, Liao, Wu and Zhang.",0.47685185185185186
Relationship between the hippocampal shape abnormality and serum cortisol levels in first-episode and drug-naïve major depressive disorder patients,2017,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011391270&doi=10.1002%2fda.22604&partnerID=40&md5=15c1d43a9d700752b9d123d39df5cff6,"Background: We aimed to investigate the relationship between the hippocampal shape deformations and the serum cortisol levels in first-episode and drug-naïve major depression disorder (MDD) patients. Methods: Thirty first-episode and drug-naïve MDD patients and 40 healthy subjects were recruited. High-resolution T1-weighted imaging and morning blood samples for cortisol measurement were obtained from all MDD patients and healthy subjects. In the hippocampal shape analysis, we compared the hippocampal shape between MDD patients and healthy subjects and evaluated the linear correlation between hippocampal shape deformations and the serum cortisol levels in MDD patients and healthy subjects. Results: MDD patients showed significant inward deformations predominantly in the cornu ammonis (CA) 1 and subiculum in bilateral hippocampi compared to healthy subjects (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected, P <.05). Furthermore, in MDD patients, a significant linear correlation between inward deformations and high cortisol levels were found predominantly in the CA1 and subiculum, extending into the CA2–3 (FDR-corrected, P <.05), whereas no significant linear correlation was observed in healthy subjects. Conclusions: The serum cortisol levels are therefore considered to be associated with hippocampal shape abnormalities in MDD. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.39444444444444443
Modes of effective connectivity within cortical pathways are distinguished for different categories of visual context: An fMRI study,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027887455&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00064&partnerID=40&md5=d730e24851259792a01513b5f70b6846,"Context contributes to accurate and efficient information processing. To reveal the dynamics of the neural mechanisms that underlie the processing of visual contexts during the recognition of color, shape, and 3D structure of objects, we carried out functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of subjects while judging the contextual validity of the three visual contexts. Our results demonstrated that the modes of effective connectivity in the cortical pathways, as well as the patterns of activation in these pathways, were dynamical depending on the nature of the visual contexts. While the fusiform gyrus, superior parietal lobe, and inferior prefrontal gyrus were activated by the three visual contexts, the temporal and parahippocampal gyrus/Amygdala (PHG/Amg) cortices were activated only by the color context. We further carried out dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis and revealed the nature of the effective connectivity involved in the three contextual information processing. DCM showed that there were dynamic connections and collaborations among the brain regions belonging to the previously identified ventral and dorsal visual pathways. © 2017 Wu, Wu, Takahashi, Huang, Sun, Guo, Ohtani, Ejima, Zhang, Li and Yan.",0.46629213483146065

However, the conclusions and generalizability of previous studies on interpersonal distance preferences were limited by some important methodological and sampling issues. The objective of the present study was to compare preferred interpersonal distances across the world and to overcome the problems observed in previous studies. We present an extensive analysis of interpersonal distances over a large data set (N = 8,943 participants from 42 countries). We attempted to relate the preferred social, personal, and intimate distances observed in each country to a set of individual characteristics of the participants, and some attributes of their cultures. Our study indicates that individual characteristics (age and gender) influence interpersonal space preferences and that some variation in results can be explained by temperature in a given region. We also present objective values of preferred interpersonal distances in different regions, which might be used as a reference data point in future studies. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.5094339622641509
Changes in Families’ Caregiving Experiences through Involvement as Participants then Facilitators in a Family Peer-Education Program for Mental Disorders in Japan,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949267323&doi=10.1111%2ffamp.12194&partnerID=40&md5=f6a0719a6a744eb797a2ebc6bebd343f,"A family peer-education program for mental disorders was developed in Japan, similar to existing programs in the United States and Hong Kong. Families that serve as facilitators in such programs may enhance their caregiving processes and, thereby, their well-being. This study's aim was to describe how families’ caregiving experiences change, beginning with the onset of a family member's mental illness, through their involvement in a family group or peer-education program as participants then facilitators. Thus, this study was conducted in a family peer-education program for mental disorders in Japan. Group interviews were conducted with 27 facilitators from seven program sites about their experiences before, during, and after becoming facilitators. Interview data were coded and categorized into five stages of caregiving processes: (1) withdrawing and suppressing negative experiences with difficulty and regret; (2) finding comfort through being listened to about negative experiences; (3) supporting participants’ sharing as facilitators; (4) understanding and affirming oneself through repeated sharing of experiences; and (5) finding value and social roles in one's experiences. The third, fourth, and fifth stages were experienced by the facilitators. The value that the facilitators placed on their caregiving experiences changed from negative to positive, which participants regarded as helpful and supportive. We conclude that serving as facilitators may improve families’ caregiving processes. © 2015 Family Process Institute",0.5240384615384616
Effects of passive finger movement on cortical excitability,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018937173&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00216&partnerID=40&md5=ff5092538c20540d7236baebad96af3a,"This study examined the effects of joint angle and passive movement direction on corticospinal excitability. The subjects were 14 healthy adults from whom consent could be obtained. We performed two experiments. In Experiment 1, we measured motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, F-wave and M-wave at 0° and 20° adduction during adduction or abduction movement, in the range of movement from 10° abduction to 30° adduction. In Experiment 2, MEPs were measured at static 0° and 20° adduction during passive adduction from 10° adduction to 30° adduction and static 20° adduction. MEP, F-waves and M-waves were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Experiment 1 revealed significantly increased MEP amplitude at 0° during passive adduction compared to static 0° (p < 0.01). No other significant differences in MEP, M-wave and F-wave parameters were observed. In Experiment 2, MEP amplitude was significantly higher at 20° adduction during passive adduction compared with static 0° (p < 0.01). Based on these findings, it appears that fluctuations in MEP amplitude values during passive movement are not influenced by joint angle, but rather it is possible that it is due to intracortical afferent facilitation (AF) dependent on afferent input due to the start of movement and interstimulus interval (ISI) of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). © 2017 Nakagawa, Sasaki, Tsuiki, Miyaguchi, Kojima, Saito, Inukai and Onishi.",0.5126903553299492

The current review aimed to synthesize qualitative research to identify facilitators and barriers to HIV retention in care interventions. A qualitative evidence meta-synthesis utilizing thematic analysis. Prospective review registration was made in PROSPERO and review procedures adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Nineteen databases were searched to identify qualitative research conducted with individuals living with HIV and their caregivers. Quality assessment was conducted using CASP and the certainty of the evidence was evaluated using CERQual. A total of 4419 citations were evaluated and 11 were included in the final meta-synthesis. Two studies were from high-income countries, 3 from middle-income countries, and 6 from low-income countries. A total of eight themes were identified as facilitators or barriers for retention in HIV care intervention: (1) Stigma and discrimination, (2) Fear of HIV status disclosure, (3) task shifting to lay health workers, (4) Human resource and institutional challenges, (5) Mobile Health (mHealth), (6) Family and friend support, (7) Intensive case management, and, (8) Relationships with caregivers. The current review suggests that task shifting interventions with lay health workers were feasible and acceptable. mHealth interventions and stigma reduction interventions appear to be promising interventions aimed at improving retention in HIV care.

Individual differences in learning behaviours in humans: Asocial exploration tendency does not predict reliance on social learning,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007199188&doi=10.1016%2fj.evolhumbehav.2016.11.001&partnerID=40&md5=d86e848df16a300e9b461f2a7a3771cb,"A number of empirical studies have suggested that individual differences in asocial exploration tendencies in animals may be related to those in social information use. However, because the ‘exploration tendency’ in most previous studies has been measured without considering the information-gathering processes, it is yet hard to conclude that the animal asocial exploration strategies may be tied to social information use. Here, we studied human learning behaviour in both asocial and social two-armed bandit tasks. By fitting reinforcement learning models including asocial and/or social decision processes, we measured each individual's (1) asocial exploration tendency and (2) social information use. We found consistent individual differences in the exploration tendency in the asocial tasks. We also found substantive heterogeneity in the adopted learning strategies in the social task: Nearly one-third of participants used predominantly the copy-when-uncertain strategy, while the remaining two-thirds were most likely to have relied only on asocial learning. However, we found no significant individual association between the exploration frequency in the asocial task and the use of the social information in the social task. Our results suggest that the social learning strategies may be independent from the asocial exploration strategies in humans. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.43523316062176165

International organizations such as OECD and WTO also increase support for developing countries in building capabilities in innovation and standardization. Yet the relationship between innovation and standardization in developing countries, characterized by relatively weaker technological, economic and institutional capacities, remain under-researched. We review 63 articles extracted from the Web of Science database covering the innovation-standardization nexus in the context of developing countries. We discuss whether and how the relationship between innovation and standardization provides implications for the socioeconomic development in developing countries, and draw a conceptual model to understand the dynamics. Our result shows that standards facilitate innovation in three ways: innovation by scaling, proving and coordinating. While inducing and blocking mechanisms are at play, various stakeholders are involved in the relationship. Among them, the roles of the government and the technology/industry support organizations are highlighted, as they complement the relatively weak technological capabilities of other actors. In contrast to the existing literature on developed countries where standardization is depicted as a dynamic process to shape the innovation path, the current discussion on developing countries is skewed toward the adoption aspect of standards. We also suggest that there is a chasm between the goals of economic growth and those of social development. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.4722222222222222

The present study examined two hypotheses on what factors contribute to the occurrence of scale errors, focusing on the following possible factors: action planning and inhibitory control, and concept of size. Thus, we hypothesize that scale errors derived from either immaturity of their action planning and inhibitory control abilities or understanding of size concepts. The results revealed that the concept of size was significantly negatively associated with the occurrence of scale errors. However, action planning and inhibitory control were not significantly associated with the occurrence of scale errors. These results suggest that scale errors may arise from a misunderstanding of size concepts. © 2017 Ishibashi and Moriguchi.",0.5581395348837209

Previous studies indicated that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the right TPJ improves social cognitive functions such as imitation-inhibition and perspective-taking. Although previous work shows that tDCS of the right IFC improves imitation-inhibition, its effects on perspective-taking have yet to be determined. In addition, the role of the TPJ and IFC in determining the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), which is a measure of autism spectrum traits, is still unclear. Thus, the current study performed tDCS on the right TPJ and the right IFC of healthy adults, and examined its effects on imitation-inhibition, perspective-taking and AQ scores. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that anodal tDCS of the right IFC and right TPJ would improve imitation-inhibition, perspective-taking and the AQ score. Anodal tDCS of the right TPJ or IFC significantly decreased the interference effect in an imitation-inhibition task and the cost of perspective-taking in a perspective-taking task, in comparison to the sham stimulation control. These findings indicated that both the TPJ and the IFC play a role in imitation-inhibition and perspective-taking, i.e., control of self and other representations. However, anodal stimulation of the right TPJ and the right IFC did not alter participants’ AQ. This finding conflicts with results from previous brain imaging studies, which could be attributed to methodological differences such as variation in sex, age and ASD. Therefore, further research is necessary to determine the relationship between the TPJ and IFC, and the AQ. © 2017 Nobusako, Nishi, Nishi, Shuto, Asano, Osumi and Morioka.",0.3283018867924528

Using data from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort data of approximately 750 pairs of twins, we examined whether genetic influences on preschoolers’ behavioral problems depended upon mothers’ depressive symptoms. Results indicated that the genetic etiology for both internalizing and externalizing behaviors varied with maternal depressive symptoms at 9-months child age. Genetic effects on externalizing behaviors increased as mothers’ depressive symptoms increased; however, genetics effects on internalizing behaviors increased when depressive symptoms either increased or decreased from the median level. These different patterns of interactive effects suggest potentially different mechanisms for the etiology of children’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0.35714285714285715

Amyloid β protein (Aβ) aggregated in the brain is one of the key pathological characteristics of AD and responsible for the deficits in learning and memory. It is reported that davunetide, an octapeptide derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), inhibited Aβ aggregation and Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. To further characterize the neuroprotective roles of davunetide and its possible mechanism, the present study investigated the effects of davunetide on Aβ1-42-induced impairments in spatial memory, synaptic plasticity and hippocampal AKT level. In Morris water maze (MWM) test, bilateral intrahippocampal injection of Aβ1-42 significantly increased escape latency and decreased target quadrant swimming time of rats, while three weeks of intranasal application of davunetide reversed the Aβ1-42-induced learning deficits and memory loss in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo field potentiation recording showed that Aβ1-42 suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats, while davunetide effectively blocked the suppression of LTP, without affecting paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). Western blotting experiments showed a significant decrease in the level of hippocampal p-AKT (Ser473), not total AKT, in Aβ1-42 only group, which was mostly antagonized by davunetide treatment. These findings demonstrate that davunetide, probably by enhancing PI3K/AKT pathway, plays an important positive role in attenuating Aβ1-42-induced impairments in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity, suggesting that davunetide could be an effective therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disease such as AD. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.4146341463414634

Complementarity as generative principle: A thought pattern for aesthetic appreciations and cognitive appraisals in general,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019651148&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00727&partnerID=40&md5=9d264f484cb69a299c36fd086c3a53a6,"In experimental aesthetics the relationship between the arts and cognitive neuroscience has gained particular interest in recent years. But has cognitive neuroscience indeed something to offer when studying the arts? Here we present a theoretical frame within which the concept of complementarity as a generative or creative principle is proposed; neurocognitive processes are characterized by the duality of complementary activities like bottom-up and top-down control, or logistical functions like temporal control and content functions like perceptions in the neural machinery. On that basis a thought pattern is suggested for aesthetic appreciations and cognitive appraisals in general. This thought pattern is deeply rooted in the history of philosophy and art theory since antiquity; and complementarity also characterizes neural operations as basis for cognitive processes. We then discuss some challenges one is confronted with in experimental aesthetics; in our opinion, one serious problem is the lack of a taxonomy of functions in psychology and neuroscience which is generally accepted. This deficit makes it next to impossible to develop acceptable models which are similar to what has to be modeled. Another problem is the severe language bias in this field of research as knowledge gained in many languages over the ages remains inaccessible to most scientists. Thus, an inspection of research results or theoretical concepts is necessarily too narrow. In spite of these limitations we provide a selective summary of some results and viewpoints with a focus on visual art and its appreciation. It is described how questions of art and aesthetic appreciations using behavioral methods and in particular brain-imaging techniques are analyzed and evaluated focusing on such issues like the representation of artwork or affective experiences. Finally, we emphasize complementarity as a generative principle on a practical level when artists and scientists work directly together which can lead to new insights and broader perspectives on both sides. © 2017 Bao, von Stosch, Park and Pöppel.",0.45980707395498394
The effects of modified constraint-induced movement therapy in acute subcortical cerebral infarction,2017,21,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85022179450&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00265&partnerID=40&md5=79c8604e084e28045333990af11d82a4,"Background: Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) promotes upper extremity recovery post stroke, however, it is difficult to implement clinically due to its high resource demand and safety of the restraint. Therefore, we propose that modified CIMT (mCIMT) be used to treat individuals with acute subcortical infarction. Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of mCIMT in patients with acute subcortical infarction, and investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the effect. Methods: The role of mCIMT was investigated in 26 individuals experiencing subcortical infarction in the preceding 14 days. Patients were randomly assigned to either mCIMT or standard therapy. mCIMT group was treated daily for 3 h over 10 consecutive working days, using a mitt on the unaffected arm for up to 30% of waking hours. The control group was treated with an equal dose of occupational therapy and physical therapy. During the 3-month follow-up, the motor functions of the affected limb were assessed by the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and Motor Activity Log (MAL). Altered cortical excitability was assessed via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Results: Treatment significantly improved the movement in the mCIMT group compared with the control group. The mean WMF score was significantly higher in the mCIMT group compared with the control group. Further, the appearance of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were significantly higher in the mCIMT group compared with the baseline data. A significant change in ipsilesional silent period (SP) occurred in the mCIMT group compared with the control group. However, we found no difference between two groups in motor function or electrophysiological parameters after 3 months of follow-up. Conclusions: mCIMT resulted in significant functional changes in timed movement immediately following treatment in patients with acute subcortical infarction. Further, early mCIMT improved ipsilesional cortical excitability. However, no long-term effects were seen. © 2017 Yu, Wang, Zhang, Wang, Hou, Liu, Gao, Wang, Mo and Wu.",0.4391891891891892

The present research investigated individuals' awareness of their own facial expressions and the influence of the duration and intensity of expressions in two self-reference modalities, a real-time condition and a video-review condition. The participants were instructed to respond as soon as they became aware of any facial movements. The results revealed that awareness rates were 57.79% in the real-time condition and 75.92% in the video-review condition. The awareness rate was influenced by the intensity and (or) the duration. The intensity thresholds for individuals to become aware of their own facial expressions were calculated using logistic regression models. The results of Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) revealed that video-review awareness was a significant predictor of real-time awareness. These findings extend understandings of human facial expression self-awareness in two modalities. © 2017 Qu, Yan, Chen, Li, Zhang and Fu.",0.43790849673202614

Methods: This follow-up study included 6,586 participants (aged 79.5 ± 9.8 years, range 65-105 years, 51.7% female) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey who were aged ≥65 years and were free of cognitive impairment in 2002. Incident cognitive impairment was defined at the 2005 or 2008/2009 survey following an education-based cut-off on the adapted Chinese version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participation in cognitive activities (e.g. reading) and non-exercise physical activity (e.g. housework) was assessed by a self-reported scale. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to examine the association of leisure activities with incident cognitive impairment while controlling for age, gender, education, occupation, residence, physical exercise, smoking, drinking, cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, negative well-being, and physical functioning, and baseline MMSE score. Results: During a five-year follow-up, 1,448 participants developed incident cognitive impairment. Overall, a high level of participation in leisure activities was associated with a 41% decreased risk of cognitive impairment compared to low-level engagement in leisure activities after controlling for age, gender, education, and other confounders. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between leisure activity and educational level, such that the beneficial effect of leisure activities on cognitive function was larger in educated elderly than their uneducated counterparts, and only educated elderly benefited from cognitive activities. Conclusions: Late-life leisure activities protect against cognitive impairment among elderly Chinese people, and the protective effects are more profound for educated elderly. © 2017 International Psychogeriatric Association.",0.5139442231075697
Domestic horses send signals to humans when they face with an unsolvable task,2017,31,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84996865581&doi=10.1007%2fs10071-016-1056-4&partnerID=40&md5=4c283bd26a867d9b23f65311007072ac,"Some domestic animals are thought to be skilled at social communication with humans due to the process of domestication. Horses, being in close relationship with humans, similar to dogs, might be skilled at communication with humans. Previous studies have indicated that they are sensitive to bodily signals and the attentional state of humans; however, there are few studies that investigate communication with humans and responses to the knowledge state of humans. Our first question was whether and how horses send signals to their potentially helpful but ignorant caretakers in a problem-solving situation where a food item was hidden in a bucket that was accessible only to the caretakers. We then examined whether horses alter their behaviours on the basis of the caretakers’ knowledge of where the food was hidden. We found that horses communicated to their caretakers using visual and tactile signals. The signalling behaviour of the horses significantly increased in conditions where the caretakers had not seen the hiding of the food. These results suggest that horses alter their communicative behaviour towards humans in accordance with humans’ knowledge state. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0.366120218579235

Following a systematic process, a four-factor structure of the SDA was identified through principle components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis that revealed four aspects of death anxiety: Dysphoria, Death Intrusion, Fear of Death, and Avoidance of Death. The results of this study indicate that the SDA has a clear factor structure and good psychometric properties. The SDA supports death anxiety as a multidimensional construct, and the foundational role of fear of death in the generation of death anxiety. This scale is valuable and beneficial to research on death anxiety. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature because the SDA is the first assessment of death anxiety to include the constructs of dysphoria and somatic symptoms. And the potential clinical practice of the SDA was discussed. © 2017 Cai, Tang, Wu and Li.",0.44642857142857145
Connectedness underlies the underestimation of the horizontal vertical illusion in L-shaped configurations,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015661932&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-017-1309-6&partnerID=40&md5=776afce2d304dd65791aadb5b3c26d63,"L-shaped configuration is a commonly used stimulus configuration in studying horizontal vertical illusion. Here, we report that the horizontal vertical illusion is substantially underestimated when the L-shaped configuration is used for evaluating the illusion. Experiment 1 found that, in a length perception task, the perceived length of a vertical bar was about 10% longer than that of a horizontal bar with the same physical size. Similar amount of HVI was found in a length comparison task, in which the length of a horizontal bar was compared to that of a vertical bar and the two bars were presented separately in space or in time. In contrast, when the length comparison task was conducted with the two bars being arranged in a connected L-shape, the illusion was halved in strength. Experiment 2 and 3 studied what might be the cause of this L-shape induced HVI-underestimation. Two factors were investigated: the connectedness of the two lines, and the 45° absolute orientation or the 45° inner angle information embedded in the upright isosceles L-shape. The results showed that the HVI strength was not much affected when the 45° absolute orientation and the 45° angle information was made useless for the length comparison task. In contrast, the illusion was significantly reduced in strength whenever the two lines were separated as compared to when they were connected. These results suggested that the connectedness of the two lines must underlie the underestimation of the horizontal vertical illusion in the L-shaped configurations. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.34024896265560167
Aberrant insula-centered functional connectivity in psychogenic erectile dysfunction patients: A resting-state fMRI study,2017,21,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020517416&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00221&partnerID=40&md5=30a8f878a9470fb2c11feb3832e6456c,"Most previous studies exploring the neural mechanism of psychogenic erectile dysfunction (pED) focused on brain activity under tasks. We suggest that the resting brain activity is equally important in pED studies, in that the patterns of spontaneous neural activities is independent of modalities of sensory input, therefore providing substantial information regarding the central mechanism of pED. Our previous study reported the altered baseline activity in right anterior insula (aINS) in pED patients. Also, the insula is a pivotal region in sexual behavior, which is suggested to be able to directly mediate erection. Therefore, the current study employed resting-state fMRI to examine alterations in functional connectivity (FC) of the aINS comparing pED patients with matched control subjects. After rigorous participant inclusion procedure, 27 pED patients and 27 healthy male controls were enrolled. Our results elucidated the disrupted homogeneity within the right aINS and aberrant connection patterns between the right aINS and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), as well as the right aINS and the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) respectively in pED group, as compared with the healthy controls. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the aberrant insula-centered FC in pED, which may be related to the abnormal representation of internal bodily state or needs in pED patients and thus further affect the inhibitory control in the sexual context. We hope that these findings may shed new light on the understanding of the central mechanism of pED. © 2017 Wang, Dong, Guan, Wu, He, Zou, Chen, Shi, Liang and Zhang.",0.4139344262295082
Effects of loss aversion on neural responses to loss outcomes: An event-related potential study,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017435812&doi=10.1016%2fj.biopsycho.2017.04.005&partnerID=40&md5=e22d02c412e445c608ce79e6bb869e7b,"Loss aversion is the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains of the same amount. To shed light on the spatio-temporal processes underlying loss aversion, we analysed the associations between individual loss aversion and electrophysiological responses to loss and gain outcomes in a monetary gamble task. Electroencephalographic feedback-related negativity (FRN) was computed in 29 healthy participants as the difference in electrical potentials between losses and gains. Loss aversion was evaluated using non-linear parametric fitting of choices in a separate gamble task. Loss aversion correlated positively with FRN amplitude (233–263 ms) at electrodes covering the lower face. Feedback related potentials were modelled by five equivalent source dipoles. From these dipoles, stronger activity in a source located in the orbitofrontal cortex was associated with loss aversion. The results suggest that loss aversion implemented during risky decision making is related to a valuation process in the orbitofrontal cortex, which manifests during learning choice outcomes. © 2017",0.44666666666666666

We find strong evidence of substantial variations in reporting behaviors by education, cognition, and family wealth but not by family income or political capital. Failing to correct for reporting heterogeneity can bias the estimates of SES gradients in self-rated health as much as nearly 40 %. After vignette adjustment, we find significantly positive associations of education, family income, wealth, and political capital with self-rated health. Individuals’ cognitive capacity, however, does not predict self-rated health. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0.4492753623188406
Oxytocin increases the perceived value of both self- and other-owned items and alters medial prefrontal cortex activity in an endowment task,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021446047&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00272&partnerID=40&md5=b8b525d793d776d8ad9295b1d27e1378,"The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) can influence self-processing and may help motivate us to value the attributes of others in a more self-like manner by reducing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) responses. We do not know however whether this OXT effect extends to possessions. We tend to place a higher monetary value on specific objects that belong to us compared to others, known as the “endowment effect”. In two double-blind, between-subject placebo (PLC) controlled experiments in subjects from a collectivist culture, we investigated the influence of intranasal OXT on the endowment effect, with the second study incorporating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the task, subjects decided whether to buy or sell their own or others’ (mother/father/classmate/stranger) possessions at various prices. Both experiments demonstrated an endowment effect in the self-owned condition which extended to close others (mother/father) and OXT increased this for self and all other-owned items. This OXT effect was associated with reduced activity in the ventral mPFC (vmPFC) in the self-owned condition but increased in the mother-condition. For the classmate-and stranger-owned conditions OXT increased activity in the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC). Changes in vmPFC activation were associated with the size of the endowment effect for self- and mother-owned items. Functional connectivity between the dmPFC and ventral striatum (VStr) was reduced by OXT in self- and mother-owned conditions and between vmPFC and precuneus in the self-condition. Overall our results show that OXT enhances the endowment effect for both self- and other-owned items in Chinese subjects. This effect is associated with reduced mPFC activation in the self-condition but enhanced activation in all other-conditions and involves differential actions on both dorsal and ventral regions as well as functional connectivity with brain reward and other self-processing regions. Overall our findings suggest that OXT increases the perceived value of both self- and other-owned items by acting on neural circuitry involved in self-processing and reward. © 2017 Zhao, Geng, Luo, Zhao, Ma, Xu, Yao and Kendrick.",0.38485804416403785
Differential signatures of second language syntactic performance and age on the structural properties of the left dorsal pathway,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019958765&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00829&partnerID=40&md5=8ebde7bbd76df523fb6e792f35637dd0,"In adult second language (L2) acquisition, individual differences are considerably large even among people with similar experiences. The neural mechanisms underlying this variability would include structural plasticity of language-related pathways. To elucidate such neuroplasticity, we focused on the transitional period of adolescence, which is associated with certain plasticity toward maturation following the sensitive period of language acquisition (=12 years old). The adolescent brain would thus be influenced by age-dependent factors, as well as performances in L2. Here, we examined individual differences in L2 performances controlling the duration of experience to reveal the differential signatures of performances and age on the plasticity of structural properties in major language-related pathways. We recruited Japanese students at two ages, i.e., junior (age: 13-14) and senior (age: 16-17) high-school students, all of whom started to expose to English at age 12 or 13. We divided them into subgroups, so that either L2 performance [Junior (High)/Senior (Low)] or age [Senior (Low)/Senior (High)] was matched in group comparisons; the duration of L2 experience was also controlled between the Senior (Low) and Senior (High) groups. We then examined the thickness and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the dorsal and ventral pathways, i.e., the arcuate fasciculus (Arcuate) and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), respectively, using semi-automatic methods for selecting regions without branches. Regarding FA in the left Arcuate, the Senior (High) group showed significantly higher FA than the other two groups, indicating performance-related group differences. Further, FA in the left Arcuate was selectively correlated with the accuracy of a syntactic task. Regarding the thickness of the left Arcuate, the Senior (High) and Senior (Low) groups showed significantly larger thickness than the Junior (High) group, indicating age-related group differences. These differential performance-related and age-related signatures were evident on the left Arcuate alone, in contrast to the right Arcuate that showed only mild differences in thickness, and to the bilateral IFOF that lacked either signature. Our results suggest that the left dorsal pathway continued to develop to adolescence, and that performance differences in a syntactic task can be predicted by its FA, independent of age and the duration of experience. © 2017 Yamamoto and Sakai.",0.43768115942028984

Knowledge gaps exist regarding the longer life and resilience-related experiences of people living with HIV (PLWH). Specifically, there is a dearth of data about the interaction of perceived risk and resilient factors resulting in a wide spectrum of intentional suicidal ideation outcomes in a Chinese cultural context. This qualitative research drew from a larger ethnographic study of newly diagnosed HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in Mainland China. Interviews were conducted with 31 MSM within 6 months of diagnosis of HIV infection. Initial suicidal ideation was commonly reported with participants subsequently feeling more resilient to these thoughts through gaining a greater understanding of their prognosis and treatment. Post-HIV diagnosis, some participants reported forming new relationships and receiving increased support from their partners, friends, peers, families, and community-based organizations. At follow-up, these participants generally reported suicidal ideation had declined. However, participants who continued to express suicidal ideation perceived extended pressure from their families’ expectations for them to engage in heterosexual marriages and parenthood. Furthermore, these men reported ongoing hardships in their daily life, unemployment, lack of social support, and isolation. Among this Mainland Chinese cohort of HIV-positive MSM, suicidal ideation may be a transient phenomenon experienced initially following HIV diagnosis that resolves with increased and specific familial, social, and service-based support. It is crucial to identify the causes of stress and social suffering associated with HIV diagnosis in order to reduce suicidal ideation. In China, action is needed to develop routine mental health screening and to increase services that support PLWH. Important services mechanism to accomplish this are promoting resilience through intentional activities as well as continued public health campaigns to reduce stigma toward HIV-positive MSM. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0.468013468013468

Empathy-related responses were observed during three simulated procedures performed by each child's primary caregiver, the experimenter and a baby doll. An exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the different components of empathy. The shared representation of the self and others was measured using the Tasks for the Observation of Self-Concept, self/other awareness was measured with a series of mirror tests and inhibitory control was measured using the Cylinder Inhibitory Control Task. The results showed that the empathy of Chinese toddlers contains three factors: sympathy, personal distress and orientation.

Specifically, we examined whether the age of acquisition (AoA) effect arose during the arbitrary mapping from conceptual knowledge onto linguistic units. The behavior and ERP data were collected when 28 Chinese-English bilinguals were asked to perform semantic relatedness judgment on word pairs, which represented three stages of word learning (i.e., primary school, junior and senior high schools). A 3 (AoA: early vs. intermediate vs. late) × 2 (regularity: regular vs. irregular) × 2 (semantic relatedness: related vs. unrelated) × 2 (hemisphere: left vs. right) × 3 (brain area: anterior vs. central vs. posterior) within-subjects design was adopted. Results from the analysis of N100 and N400 amplitudes showed that early learned words had an advantage in processing accuracy and speed; there is a tendency that the AoA effect was more pronounced for irregular word pairs and in the semantic related condition. More important, ERP results showed early acquired words induced larger N100 amplitudes for early AoA words in the parietal area and more negative-going N400 than late acquire words in the frontal and central regions. The results indicate the locus of the AoA effect might derive from the arbitrary mapping between word forms and semantic concepts, and early acquired words have more semantic interconnections than late acquired words. © 2017 Xue, Liu, Marmolejo-Ramos and Pei.",0.45374449339207046

Although certain studies using a two-player ultimatum game (UG) have shown that comparison with the proposers influences the responders' fairness perceptions in a gain context, the effect of counterfactual comparison in a UG with multiple responders or proposers remains unclear, especially in a loss context. To resolve these issues, this study used a modified three-player UG with multiple responders in Experiment 1 and multiple proposers in Experiment 2 to examine the influence of counterfactual comparison on fairness-related decision-making in gain and loss contexts. The two experiments consistently showed that regardless of the gain or loss context, the level of inequality of the offer and counterfactual comparison influenced acceptance rates (ARs), response times (RTs), and fairness ratings (FRs). If the offers that were received were better than the counterfactual offers, unequal offers were more likely to be accepted than equal offers, and participants were more likely to report higher FRs and to make decisions more quickly. In contrast, when the offers they received were worse than the counterfactual offers, participants were more likely to reject unequal offers than equal offers, reported lower FRs, and made decisions more slowly. These results demonstrate that responders' fairness perceptions are influenced by not only comparisons of the absolute amount of money that they would receive but also specific counterfactuals from other proposers or responders. These findings improve our understanding of fairness perceptions. © 2017 Li, Wang, Taxer, Yang, Zheng and Liu.",0.45

In this paper, we set out to study the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate levels and memory performance, which we believe has not been reported previously. In particular, we focused on recall performance broken down by serial position. Our prediction was that the recency ratio (Rr), a novel cognitive marker of intellectual impairment, would be linked with CSF glutamate levels. We studied data from a group of cognitively intact elderly individuals, 28 of whom had MDD, while 19 were controls.

Integration of the forced-choice questionnaire and the likert scale: A simulation study,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019638177&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00806&partnerID=40&md5=bdacd6f1a558835440507270585c16cd,"The Thurstonian item response theory (IRT) model allows estimating the latent trait scores of respondents directly through their responses in forced-choice questionnaires. It solves a part of problems brought by the traditional scoring methods of this kind of questionnaires. However, the forced-choice designs may still have their own limitations: The model may encounter underidentification and non-convergence and the test may show low test reliability in simple test designs (e.g., test designs with only a small number of traits measured or short length). To overcome these weaknesses, the present study applied the Thurstonian IRT model and the Graded Response Model to a different test format that comprises both forced-choice blocks and Likert-type items. And the Likert items should have low social desirability. A Monte Carlo simulation study is used to investigate how the mixed response format performs under various conditions. Four factors are considered: the number of traits, test length, the percentage of Likert items, and the proportion of pairs composed of items keyed in opposite directions. Results reveal that the mixed response format can be superior to the forced-choice format, especially in simple designs where the latter performs poorly. Besides the number of Likert items needed is small. One point to note is that researchers need to choose Likert items cautiously as Likert items may bring other response biases to the test. Discussion and suggestions are given to construct personality tests that can resist faking as much as possible and have acceptable reliability. © 2017 Xiao, Liu and Li.",0.46963562753036436
The association between childhood adversities and subsequent first onset of psychotic experiences: A cross-national analysis of 23 998 respondents from 17 countries,2017,99,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008656615&doi=10.1017%2fS0033291716003263&partnerID=40&md5=b3a737451ae73405949f915a25fbde20,"Background Although there is robust evidence linking childhood adversities (CAs) and an increased risk for psychotic experiences (PEs), little is known about whether these associations vary across the life-course and whether mental disorders that emerge prior to PEs explain these associations. Method We assessed CAs, PEs and DSM-IV mental disorders in 23 998 adults in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. Discrete-time survival analysis was used to investigate the associations between CAs and PEs, and the influence of mental disorders on these associations using multivariate logistic models. Results Exposure to CAs was common, and those who experienced any CAs had increased odds of later PEs [odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-2.6]. CAs reflecting maladaptive family functioning (MFF), including abuse, neglect, and parent maladjustment, exhibited the strongest associations with PE onset in all life-course stages. Sexual abuse exhibited a strong association with PE onset during childhood (OR 8.5, 95% CI 3.6-20.2), whereas Other CA types were associated with PE onset in adolescence. Associations of other CAs with PEs disappeared in adolescence after adjustment for prior-onset mental disorders. The population attributable risk proportion (PARP) for PEs associated with all CAs was 31% (24% for MFF). Conclusions Exposure to CAs is associated with PE onset throughout the life-course, although sexual abuse is most strongly associated with childhood-onset PEs. The presence of mental disorders prior to the onset of PEs does not fully explain these associations. The large PARPs suggest that preventing CAs could lead to a meaningful reduction in PEs in the population. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.",0.4024390243902439
Proposers' economic status affects behavioral and neural responses to unfairness,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021384308&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00847&partnerID=40&md5=a6a6e3e35db086eca618e508892baa68,"Economic status played an important role in the modulation of economic decision making. The present fMRI study aimed at investigating how economic status modulated behavioral and neural responses to unfairness in a modified Ultimatum Game (UG). During scanning, participants played as responders in the UG, and they were informed of the economic status of proposers before receiving offers. At the behavioral level, higher rejection rates and lower fairness ratings were revealed when proposers were in high economic status than in low economic status. Besides, the most time-consuming decisions tended to occur at lower unfairness level when the proposers were in high (relative to low) economic status. At the neural level, stronger activation of left thalamus was revealed when fair offers were proposed by proposers in high rather than in low economic status. Greater activation of right medial prefrontal cortex was revealed during acceptance to unfair offers in high economic status condition rather than in low economic status condition. Taken together, these findings shed light on the significance of proposers' economic status in responders' social decision making in UG. © 2017 Zheng, Cheng, Xu, Zheng, Li, Yang and Guo.",0.4838709677419355
Appetitive olfactory learning and long-term associative memory in Caenorhabditis elegans,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019213467&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00080&partnerID=40&md5=1866954f4394022936476caa0717cc52,"Because of the relative simplicity of its nervous system, Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful model organism to study learning and memory at cellular and molecular levels. For appetitive conditioning in C. elegans, food has exclusively been used as an unconditioned stimulus (US). It may be difficult to analyze neuronal circuits for associative memory since food is a multimodal combination of olfactory, gustatory, and mechanical stimuli. Here, we report classical appetitive conditioning and associative memory in C. elegans, using 1-nonanol as a conditioned stimulus (CS), and potassium chloride (KCl) as a US. Before conditioning, C. elegans innately avoided 1-nonanol, an aversive olfactory stimulus, and was attracted by KCl, an appetitive gustatory stimulus, on assay agar plates. Both massed training without an intertrial interval (ITI) and spaced training with a 10-min ITI induced significant levels of memory of association regarding the two chemicals. Memory induced by massed training decayed within 6 h, while that induced by spaced training was retained for more than 6 h. Animals treated with inhibitors of transcription or translation formed the memory induced by spaced training less efficiently than untreated animals, whereas the memory induced by massed training was not significantly affected by such treatments. By definition, therefore, memories induced by massed training and spaced training are classified as short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM), respectively. When animals conditioned by spaced training were exposed to 1-nonanol alone, their learning index was lower than that of untreated animals, suggesting that extinction learning occurs in C. elegans. In support of these results, C. elegans mutants defective in nmr-1, encoding an NMDA receptor subunit, formed both STM and LTM less efficiently than wild-type animals, while mutations in crh-1, encoding a ubiquitous transcription factor CREB required for memory consolidation, affected LTM, but not STM. The paradigm established in the present study should allow us to elucidate neuronal circuit plasticity for appetitive learning and memory in C. elegans. © 2017 Nishijima and Maruyama.",0.4668769716088328
Narcissism and the strategic pursuit of short-term mating: Universal links across 11 world regions of the international sexuality description project-2; [Narcisismo y búsqueda estratégica del emparejamiento a corto plazo a través de las culturas: Enlaces omnipresentes a través de 11 regiones mundiales del Proyecto de la descripción de la sexualidad internacional 2],2017,29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019148564&doi=10.31820%2fpt.26.1.5&partnerID=40&md5=9bc2050051f44f7a768226f3f2b45e37,"Previous studies have documented links between sub-clinical narcissism and the active pursuit of short-term mating strategies (e.g., unrestricted sociosexuality, marital infidelity, mate poaching). Nearly all of these investigations have relied solely on samples from Western cultures. In the current study, responses from a cross-cultural survey of 30,470 people across 53 nations spanning 11 world regions (North America, Central/South America, Northern Europe, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Oceania, Southeast Asia, and East Asia) were used to evaluate whether narcissism (as measured by the Narcissistic Personality Inventory; NPI) was universally associated with short-term mating. Results revealed narcissism scores (including two broad factors and seven traditional facets as measured by the NPI) were functionally equivalent across cultures, reliably associating with key sexual outcomes (e.g., more active pursuit of short-term mating, intimate partner violence, and sexual aggression) and sex-related personality traits (e.g., higher extraversion and openness to experience). Whereas some features of personality (e.g., subjective well-being) were universally associated with socially adaptive facets of Narcissism (e.g., self-sufficiency), most indicators of short-term mating (e.g., unrestricted sociosexuality and marital infidelity) were universally associated with the socially maladaptive facets of narcissism (e.g., exploitativeness). Discussion addresses limitations of these cross-culturally universal findings and presents suggestions for future research into revealing the precise psychological features of narcissism that facilitate the strategic pursuit of short-term mating. © 2017, Faculty of Arts and Sciences in Rijeka.

The age effects on the cognitive processes of intention-based and stimulus-based actions: An ERP study,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021371308&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00803&partnerID=40&md5=fbceef3e3d07876d3ca7f3805b4bc792,"The functional decline in action among older adults is caused not only by physical weakness but also by cognitive decline. In this study, we aimed to compare the cognitive effects of age between intention-based and stimulus-based action modes electrophysiologically. Because age-related declines in cognitive function might proceed distinctly according to specific action modes and processes, four specific cognitive processes, action-effect binding, stimulus-response linkage, action-effect feedback control, and effect-action retrieval, were investigated. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during a modified acquisition-test paradigm in young (mean age = 21, SD = 2) and old (mean age = 69, SD = 5) groups. A temporal bisection task and a movement pre-cuing task were used during the acquisition and test phases, respectively. Using ERP indices including readiness potential (RP), P3, N2 and contingent negative variation (CNV) to identify these four specific processes for the two action modes, we revealed the effects of age on each ERP index. The results showed similar patterns of waveforms but consistently decreasing amplitudes of all four ERP indices in the old age group compared with the young age group, which indicates not only generally declining functions of action preparation in older adults but also age effects specific to the action modes and processes that might otherwise be mixed together under confounding experimental conditions. Particularly, an interference effect indexed by the differences in the amplitudes of CNV between congruent and incongruent tasks was observed in the young age group, which is consistent with previous behavioral reports. However, this effect was absent in the old age group, indicating a specific age-related deficit in the effect-action retrieval process of intention-based action, which might be caused by an age-related deficit in associative memory. In sum, this study investigated the cognitive processes of two action modes from a developmental perspective and suggests the importance of adding associative memory training to interventions for older adults with the aim of improving intention-based action. © 2017 Niu, Zhu and Li.",0.5271565495207667
Age of onset and family history as indicators of polygenic risk for major depression,2017,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011632910&doi=10.1002%2fda.22607&partnerID=40&md5=ca3c0599ce1cb1d9c137e695af2298f5,"Background: The extent to which earlier age of onset (AO) is a reflection of increased genetic risk for major depression (MD) is still unknown. Previous biometrical research has provided mixed empirical evidence for the genetic overlap of AO with MD. If AO is demonstrated to be relevant to molecular polygenic risk for MD, incorporation of AO as a phenotype could enhance future genetic studies. Methods: This research estimated the SNP-based heritability of AO in the China, Oxford and VCU Experimental Research on Genetic Epidemiology (CONVERGE) case-control sample (N = 9,854; MD case, n = 4,927). Common single nucleotide polymorphism heritability of MD was also examined across both high and low median-split AO groups, and best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) scores of polygenic risk, in split-halves, were used to predict AO. Distributions of genetic risk across early and late AO were compared, and presence of self-reported family history (FH) of MD was also examined as a predictor of AO. Results: AO was not significantly heritable and polygenic risk derived from the aggregated effects of common genetic variants did not significantly predict AO in any analysis. AO was modestly but significantly lower in cases with a first-degree genetic FH of MD. Conclusions: Findings indicate that AO is associated with greater self-reported genetic risk for MD in cases, yet not associated with common variant polygenic risk for MD. Future studies of early MD may benefit more from the examination of important moderating variables such as early life events. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.3319672131147541
"Selegiline ameliorates depression-like behavior in mice lacking the CD157/BST1 gene, a risk factor for Parkinson’s disease",2017,42,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019184172&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00075&partnerID=40&md5=56d565a779bedf49dc4aa14587f88a22,"Parkinson’s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is accompanied by various non-motor symptoms including depression and anxiety, which may precede the onset of motor symptoms. Selegiline is an irreversible monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor, and is widely used in the treatment of PD and major depression. However, there are few reports about the effects of selegiline on non-motor symptoms in PD. The aim of this study was to explore the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of selegiline, using CD157/BST1 knockout (CD157 KO) mouse, a PD-related genetic model displaying depression and anxiety, compared with other antiparkinsonian drugs and an antidepressant, and was to investigate the effects of selegiline on biochemical parameters in emotion-related brain regions. A single administration of selegiline (1–10 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST) in CD157 KO mice, but not C57BL/6N wild-type (WT) mice. At 10 mg/kg, but not 3 mg/kg, selegiline significantly increased climbing time in CD157 KO mice. A single administration of the antiparkinsonian drugs pramipexole (a dopamine (DA) D2/D3 receptor agonist) or rasagiline (another MAO-B inhibitor), and repeated injections of a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), mirtazapine, also decreased immobility time, but did not increase climbing time, in CD157 KO mice. The antidepressant-like effects of 10 mg/kg selegiline were comparable to those of 10 mg/kg rasagiline, and tended to be stronger than those of 1 mg/kg rasagiline. After the FST, CD157 KO mice showed decreases in striatal and hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) content, cortical norepinephrine (NE) content, and plasma corticosterone concentration. A single administration of selegiline at 10 mg/kg returned striatal 5-HT, cortical NE, and plasma corticosterone levels to those observed in WT mice. In the open field test (OFT), repeated administration of mirtazapine had anxiolytic effects, and selegiline nonsignificantly ameliorated anxiety-like behaviors in CD157 KO mice. In the social interaction and preference tests, repeated mirtazapine ameliorated the high anxiety and low sociability of CD157 KO mice, whereas selegiline did not. These results indicate that selegiline has antidepressant and mild anxiolytic effects in CD157 KO mice, and suggest that it is an effective antiparkinsonian drug for depressive and anxiety symptoms in PD patients with a CD157 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). © 2017 Kasai, Yoshihara, Lopatina, Ishihara and Higashida.",0.3539325842696629
Sensation seeking and online gaming addiction in adolescents: A moderated mediation model of positive affective Associations and Impulsivity,2017,60,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019570795&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00699&partnerID=40&md5=430ef4fd6d8b67403995a620fbd6ad8b,"Based on the Dual Systems Model (Somerville et al., 2010; Steinberg, 2010a) and the biosocial-affect model (Romer and Hennessy, 2007) of adolescent sensation seeking and problem behaviors, the present study examined how (affective associations with online games as a mediator) and when (impulsivity as a moderator) did sensation seeking influence online gaming addiction in adolescence. A total of 375 Chinese male adolescents (mean age = 16.02 years, SD = 0.85) from southern China completed anonymous questionnaires regarding sensation seeking, positive affective associations with online games, impulsivity, and online gaming addiction. Our findings revealed that sensation seeking, positive affective associations with online games and impulsivity were each significantly and positively associated with online gaming addiction in adolescents. Positive affective associations mediated the relationship between sensation seeking and online gaming addiction. Further, impulsivity moderated the relationship between positive affective associations and online gaming addiction, such that the association between positive affective association and online gaming addiction was stronger for high than for low impulsivity adolescents. These findings underscore the importance of integrating the biosocial-affect model and the Dual Systems Model to understand how and when sensation seeking impacts adolescent online gaming addiction. © 2017 Hu, Zhen, Yu, Zhang and Zhang.",0.4603174603174603
Reorganization of brain function after a short-term behavioral intervention for stuttering,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009837083&doi=10.1016%2fj.bandl.2017.01.001&partnerID=40&md5=325f91ccd0ce66933d93ad0305e836ae,"This study investigated changes in brain function that occurred over a 7-day behavioral intervention for adults who stutter (AWS). Thirteen AWS received the intervention (AWS+), and 13 AWS did not receive the intervention (AWS−). There were 13 fluent controls (FC−). All participants were scanned before and after the intervention. Whole-brain analysis pre-intervention showed significant differences in task-related brain activation between AWS and FC− in the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and left middle temporal cortex, but there were no differences between the two AWS groups. Across the 7-day period of the intervention, AWS+ alone showed a significant increase of brain activation in the left ventral IFC/insula. There were no changes in brain function for the other two groups. Further analysis revealed that the change did not correlate with resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) that AWS showed in the cerebellum (Lu et al., 2012). However, both changes in task-related brain function and RSFC correlated with changes in speech fluency level. Together, these findings suggest that functional reorganization in a brain region close to the left IFC that shows anomalous function in AWS, occurs after a short-term behavioral intervention for stuttering. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.3155080213903743

Given that most entries in emotional facial stimuli databases were developed with western samples, and given that very few of the eastern emotional facial stimuli sets were based strictly on the Ekman's Facial Action Coding System, developing valid emotional facial stimuli of eastern samples remains a high priority. Aims: To develop and examine the psychometric properties of six basic emotional facial stimuli recruiting professional Korean actors and actresses based on the Ekman's Facial Action Coding System for the Korea University Facial Expression Collection-Second Edition (KUFEC-II). Materials And Methods: Stimulus selection was done in two phases. First, researchers evaluated the clarity and intensity of each stimulus developed based on the Facial Action Coding System. Second, researchers selected a total of 399 stimuli from a total of 57 actors and actresses, which were then rated on accuracy, intensity, valence, and arousal by 75 independent raters. Conclusion: The hit rates between the targeted and rated expressions of the KUFEC-II were all above 80%, except for fear (50%) and disgust (63%). The KUFEC-II appears to be a valid emotional facial stimuli database, providing the largest set of emotional facial stimuli. The mean intensity score was 5.63 (out of 7), suggesting that the stimuli delivered the targeted emotions with great intensity. All positive expressions were rated as having a high positive valence, whereas all negative expressions were rated as having a high negative valence.

Specifically, a sequential mediational model was proposed in which the FCU was hypothesized to promote peer preference (i.e., higher acceptance and lower rejection by peers) in middle childhood through its positive effects on parent-child interaction and child effortful control in early childhood. Participants were 731 low-income families (49 % female). Qualities of parent-child interaction were observed during structured activities at 2 to 5 years, child effortful control was assessed using behavioral tasks at 5 years, and peer acceptance and rejection were rated by teachers at 7.5 to 10.5 years. Results indicated that the FCU indirectly predicted peer preference by sequentially improving parent-child interaction and child effortful control. The findings are discussed with respect to implications for understanding mechanisms by which early parenting-focused programs may enhance child functioning across time and context. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0.4391891891891892

Two thousand five hundred thirty university students (1372 males and 1158 females) from a Chinese university completed the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale, and the Family Assessment Device (FAD). Six hundred and forty-five (25.69%) students reported grandparenting experience and they reported lower scores on self-esteem and social support than the students raised only by their parents. The grandparenting group scored higher on such dimensions of family functioning as Communication, Role, Affective Involvement, Affective Responsiveness, and General Family Function (GF) than their counterpart group. For both groups, self-esteem scores were positively correlated with social support scores, while negatively correlated with FAD all sub-scale scores. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that for the students with grandparenting experience the social support moderated the relationship between GF and self-esteem. When students reported a high level of social support, those with low GF score reported higher scores in self-esteem than those with low self-esteem. However, in case of low social support, there were no differences in self-esteem between groups with high and low GF scores. These findings suggest that social support plays a positive role to relieve the adverse impact of poor family function on self-esteem of the adolescents with grandparenting experience. In addition, the significance and limitations of the results will be discussed. © 2017 Shi, Wang, Yao, Su, Zhao and Zhan.",0.49382716049382713

Others have argued that people make inferences based on available knowledge. To examine the boundary between heuristic and knowledge usage, we examine binary choice inference processes in terms of attribute substitution in heuristic use (Kahneman & Frederick, 2005). In this framework, it is predicted that people will rely on heuristic or knowledge-based inference depending on the subjective difficulty of the inference task. We conducted competitive tests of binary choice inference models representing simple heuristics (fluency and familiarity heuristics) and knowledge-based inference models. We found that a simple heuristic model (especially a familiarity heuristic model) explained inference patterns for subjectively difficult inference tasks, and that a knowledge-based inference model explained subjectively easy inference tasks. These results were consistent with the predictions of the attribute substitution framework. Issues on usage of simple heuristics and psychological processes are discussed.

There are six basic facial expressions that may be recognized in humans (fear, sadness, surprise, happiness, anger, and disgust); however, fearful faces and surprised faces are easily confused in rapid presentation. The functional organization of the facial expression recognition system embodies a distinction between these two emotions, which is investigated in the present study. A core system that includes the right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 30), fusiform gyrus, and amygdala mediates the visual recognition of fear and surprise. We found that fearful faces evoked greater activity in the left precuneus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), middle frontal gyrus, and right lingual gyrus, whereas surprised faces were associated with greater activity in the right postcentral gyrus and left posterior insula. These findings indicate the importance of common and separate mechanisms of the neural activation that underlies the recognition of fearful and surprised faces. © 2017 Zhao, Zhao, Zhang, Cui and Fu.",0.5123456790123457

In SSD patients who underwent CI, qEEG data were collected: (1) before CI, (2) 6 months post-operatively with CI-on, and (3) 30 min after CI-off and source-localized cortical activity/functional connectivity analyses were performed. Compared to the pre-operative baseline, the CI-on condition demonstrated significantly decreased activity in the right auditory- and orbitofrontal cortices (OFC) for the delta frequency band as well as decreased connectivity between the auditory cortex/posterior cingulate cortex for the delta/beta2 bands. Meanwhile, compared to the CI-off condition, the CI-on condition displayed decreased activity in the right auditory cortices/OFC for the delta band, and in bilateral auditory cortices, left inferior frontal cortex/OFC for the gamma band. However, qEEG analyses showed no significant differences between the CI-off and baseline conditions. CI induced overall decreased cortical activity and functional connectivity.

Dissociations of RT and TOJ have been reported earlier in which increases in stimulus intensity such as luminance intensity results in a decrease of RT, whereas perceived perceptual latency in a TOJ task is affected to a lesser degree. Here, we report that a simple manipulation of stimulus size has stronger effects on perceptual latency measured by TOJ than on motor latency measured by RT tasks. When participants were asked to respond to the appearance of a simple stimulus such as a luminance blob, the perceptual latency measured against a standard reference stimulus was up to 40 ms longer for a larger stimulus. In other words, the smaller stimulus was perceived to occur earlier than the larger one. RT on the other hand was hardly affected by size. The TOJ results were further replicated in a simultaneity judgement task, suggesting that the effects of size are not due to TOJ-specific response biases but more likely reflect an effect on perceived timing. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.35858585858585856

Using data from the 2014 Chinese Survey of Consumer Finance, financial literacy was measured and further categorized into basic financial literacy and advanced financial literacy. This study tested the hypothesis that financial literacy affects household choice between stock and mutual fund. The results indicated that households with higher financial literacy, especially those with higher level of advanced financial literacy tended to delegate at least part of their portfolio to experts and invest in mutual fund. However, households who were overconfident about their financial literacy tended to invest by themselves and were more likely to hold only stocks in their portfolios. The findings also indicated that households with higher financial literacy had a better chance of receiving a positive investment return, suggesting that higher financial literacy may result in a better financial outcome. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0.44516129032258067
Temporal changes in individualism and their ramification in Japan: Rising individualism and conflicts with persisting collectivism,2017,77,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019615578&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00695&partnerID=40&md5=b89a75df46c9244b881ae6ffa36701ec,"Many studies have shown that American culture has become more individualistic over time. However, it was unclear whether other cultures, especially East Asian cultures, have also shifted toward greater individualism. Therefore, this article reviewed studies investigating temporal changes in individualism in Japan and their ramifications on psychology and behavior. Japan has experienced rapid and dramatic economic growth and urbanization and has adopted more social systems based on individualistic concepts in various contexts (e.g., workplace, school). Recent studies have suggested that, along with these socioeconomic changes, Japanese culture has become more individualistic over time. Specifically, the divorce rate increased and household size decreased. Moreover, people give more unique names to their children and dogs, and individualistic words such as ""individual"" and ""uniqueness"" appear more frequently in newspapers. Furthermore, social values became more individualistic. Yet, it has also been shown that some collectivistic values still remain. As a result, people have difficulty in adapting to this coexistence, which injures interpersonal relationships and well-being. This paper discussed how Japanese culture changed over time and how such changes affected Japanese psychology and behavior. © 2017 Ogihara.",0.5388888888888889

Prior studies have confirmed that the self-serving bias is pervasive in the general population, yet it varies significantly across situations involving ambiguous contexts. The present study features an unambiguous context encompassing interpersonal events that involved implicit causality (with the ""self"" as an actor or recipient), the inherent logic of which indicated attribution criteria. The aim of this study was to explore whether there is a self-serving bias in unambiguous contexts and to examine whether it is as sensitive to situation as it has been shown to be in ambiguous contexts. The results showed that, in an unambiguous context, participants exhibited self-serving bias in relation to attribution associated with negative interpersonal events. Additionally, the self-serving bias was greater in the actor condition relative to the recipient condition (Study 1), and this effect was not affected by the level of self-awareness, which was manipulated by the use or otherwise of a camera during the experiment (Study 2). Our findings provide evidence for the existence of the self-serving bias in unambiguous contexts. Moreover, the self-serving bias was shown to be immune to situation in unambiguous contexts, but it did depend on factors associated with the events per se, such as the actor versus recipient role that the self played in interpersonal events. © 2017 Wang, Zheng, Li, Zheng, Sun, Zhou and Guo.",0.3943089430894309
Mapping the paths from styles of anger experience and expression to obsessive-compulsive symptoms: The moderating roles of family cohesion and adaptability,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019541342&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00671&partnerID=40&md5=fc996031d662f0f24bd1959878d49da0,"Previous research has shown strong connections of anger experience and expression with obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. Additionally, studies have demonstrated links between family environment variables and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our study aims to integrate the perspectives from these two literatures by exploring the moderating roles of family cohesion and family adaptability in the relationship between anger proneness and suppression and OCD symptoms. A total of 2008 college students were recruited from a comprehensive university in Shanghai, China between February and May 2016. The subjects completed self-report inventories, including the Symptom Check List-90, State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (Chinese version), and Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale, second edition (Chinese Version). Controlling for age, one-child family status, ethnicity, family income, current depression, and anxiety, our analyses showed that the association between anger proneness and OC symptoms was moderated by family cohesion among men and that family adaptability moderated the connection between anger suppression and OC complaints among women. The findings imply that a more cohesive and empathic family environment may protect male students with high levels of anger proneness from developing OC behaviors or thoughts. The results suggest that for female subjects who are accustomed to suppressing angry feelings, flexible family coping strategies and communication atmospheres would reduce their vulnerability to OC symptoms. The findings are somewhat consistent with those of previous studies on psychotherapy outcomes that showed that OCD patients benefitted from psychotherapeutic interventions that cultivated the clients' family cohesion and adaptability. © 2017 Liu, Liu and Zhao.",0.5394190871369294

Based on the socio-ecological model, risk factors in 4 domains: family background/structure, maternal stressors, mother-child interaction, and child behavioral issue in relation to physical assault, neglect, both physical assault and neglect, and either physical assault or neglect among Chinese young mothers in Hong Kong were assessed. 392 young mothers were recruited from an integrated supportive program for young mothers. The mean age of mothers at delivery was 21.8 (SD = 3.0) and 52.3% were married. Individual risk factors and cumulative risk domains related to different child maltreatment groups were examined. Our results show both overlapping and unique risk factors across the domains associated with physical assault and neglect. Further, young families exposed to higher number of risk domains show higher rates for physical assault and neglect, co-occurrence of physical assault and neglect, and either form of maltreatment. In addition, various risk domains were found to be particularly important for different forms of maltreatment: family background/structure domain was found to be an important risk domain for neglect; mother-child interaction domain for both physical assault and neglect; family background/structure and maternal stressors domains for either physical assault or neglect. Closer examination of a subgroup of adolescent mothers aged 18 and below shows that family background/structure was an important risk domain for this group. © 2017",0.5822784810126582

Studies have revealed several factors including socioeconomic factors, which may vary among different cultural background and population. However, investigation in general Japanese population of preschool age has not been well demonstrated. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine associated factors of childhood behavioural problems using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in a prospective birth cohort study. Methods: Total 3813 SDQ were distributed between October 2014 and December 2015 to the subpopulation of prospective birth cohort study, the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health. The subpopulation consisted of participants who had reached age 5 and were born between April 2008 and December 2010. Baseline questionnaire filled at recruitment and birth record were used to obtain participant information. Children with total difficulties score ≧ 13 were defined as likelihood of behavioural problems. A total of 2553 children with valid answers were included into the analysis. The response rate was 67.1%. Results: Number of children with likelihood of behavioural problems was 521 (20.4%). Boys showed more problematic scores than girls. Multivariate analysis found that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI ≧ 30 kg/m2, primipara, maternal education lower than high school, family income during pregnancy < 3 million yen/year and boy gender were the factors associated with increased odds ratio of likelihood of child behavioural problems. Conclusions: This study found that prenatal socioeconomic factors were associated with likelihood of child behavioural problems at preschool age in Japan. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",0.423728813559322
Timing of gun fire influences sprinters' multiple joint reaction times of whole body in block start,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019612580&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00810&partnerID=40&md5=461995f6fb859101578f2a5f515afd1d,"Experienced sprinters are specifically adapted to pre-planning an advanced motor program. Herein, sprinters are able to immediately accelerate their center of mass forward with a whole-body coordinated motion, following a steady state crouched position. We examined the effect of variable timing of reaction signals on multiple joint reaction times (RT) and whole-body RT for specialist sprinters. Twenty well-experienced male sprinters performed five start-dashes from a block start under five variable foreperiod (FP) length conditions (1.465, 1.622, 1.780, 1.938, and 2.096 s), with trials randomly timed between a warning and an imperative tone. Participants' sprinting motion and ground reaction forces of their four limbs during the block start were measured simultaneously. Whole-body RT was significantly shorter when FP length was longer; the values of whole-body RT were 117 ± 5 ms, 129 ± 5 ms, 125 ± 4 ms, 133 ± 6 ms, and 156 ± 8 ms in the 2.096, 1.938, 1.780, 1.622, and 1.465-s FP-length conditions, respectively. A repeated-measures analysis of variance found a significant joint-by-FP length interaction in joint-moment RT. These findings suggest that FP length affects coordinated motion in four limbs and whole-body RT. This information will be able to lead to new methods for start signals in sprint running events and advance our understanding of the association between FP length and dynamic coordinated motion. © 2017 Otsuka, Kurihara and Isaka.",0.3686868686868687

The pathophysiology of BPS remains unclear. Several neuroimaging studies have suggested dysfunction of sensory processing and sensorimotor integration, but the results have been inconsistent. This study aimed to determine whether patients with BPS exhibit altered functional brain connectivity and to explore possible correlations between these networks and clinical variables. Twenty-five patients with BPS and 25 healthy controls were enrolled. We found that the patient group exhibited decreased connectivity within the sensory-motor network (SMN), which involved regions of the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), right premotor cortex, bilateral precuneus and left superior parietal cortex. Within the right frontoparietal network, decreased connections were observed in the middle frontal gyrus, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Regarding the salience network (SN), increased connectivity was observed in the left superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. These findings suggest the involvement of multiple neural networks in primary BPS. © 2017 Huang, Zhu, Shan, Pei, Liang, Zhou, Ni, Miao, Xu, Zhang and Luo.",0.45977011494252873

Method: This naturalistic, longitudinal study focused on 241 cancer patients receiving psycho-oncological care in the Netherlands. Data were collected before initiation of psychological care (T1), 3 months (T2), and 9 months thereafter (T3). Latent transition analysis was performed examining research questions. Results: Three distinct co-morbidity patterns were identified: class 1 (‘mood disturbances and fatigue’), class 2 (‘mood disturbances’) and class 3 (‘few symptoms of mood disturbances and fatigue’). Half of those in class 1 remained in this group from T1 to T3, a quarter transitioned to class 2 and another quarter to class 3. Baseline physical symptoms distinguished these transitions: those with more physical symptoms tended to remain stable. Half of patients in class 2 remained stable from T1 to T3, 46% moved into class 3 and 8% into class 1. Baseline physical symptoms and years after cancer diagnosis significantly distinguished these transitions: the 8% moving to class 1 had more physical symptoms and were longer after cancer diagnosis. Most patients in class 3 remained stable from T1 to T3, and predictors of transitions could not be examined. Conclusions: Three distinct co-morbidity patterns of depression, anxiety and fatigue were identified and exhibited different symptom courses longitudinally. Those with poor physical health tended to report elevated mood disturbances and fatigue during psychological care. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The present study considers whether quantitative sleep electroencephalography (EEG) may be a neurobiological correlate of suicidal ideation. Methods Participants included 84 (45 female, mean age=26.6) adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). The item that measures thoughts of death or suicide on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) was used to classify 47 participants as low suicidal ideation (24 females, mean age=26.1) and 37 as high suicidal ideation (21 females, mean age=27.3). Data were obtained from archival samples collected at the University of Michigan and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center between 2004 and 2012. Sleep EEG was quantified using power spectral analysis, and focused on alpha, beta, and delta frequencies. Results Results indicated that participants with high compared to low suicidal ideation experienced 1) increased fast frequency activity, 2) decreased delta activity, and 3) increased alpha-delta sleep after adjusting for age, sex, depression, and insomnia symptoms. Limitations Limitations include the exclusion of imminent suicidal intent, a single suicidal ideation item, and cross-sectional archival data. Conclusions This is one of the first studies to provide preliminary support that electrophysiological brain activity during sleep is associated with increased suicidal ideation in MDD, and may point toward central nervous system (CNS) hyperarousal during sleep as a neurobiological correlate of suicidal ideation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.4888888888888889

Aim: The aim of this study was to test for any relationship between impaired executive function in adolescents with conduct disorder and subsequent recidivism up to 3 years later. Method: In this prospective cohort study, 221 male adolescents with conduct disorder, admitted to a juvenile justice assessment centre for the first time, were interviewed about their offence, age, onset of delinquency and family history. They completed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Keio version) (KWCST) and the Iowa gambling task. Scores were compared between those who subsequently re-offended and those who did not. Results: Seventy-six (34%) participants re-offended. There was no direct difference between groups in executive function, but there were age differences both in executive function and in recidivism. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the variables, which were independently associated with recidivism, were younger age, change in the person who brought up the child, and fewer (≤4) categories achieved on the KWCST. Recidivists were about twice as likely as single offenders to have achieved four categories or less on the KWCST (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1–4.4). Conclusions: Impaired executive function appears to predispose to recidivism among young first-time male offenders with conduct disorder. Our findings also suggest that further precise assessments of environmental stress on developing neurocognitive function could clarify the background of antisocial behaviour. © 2016 The Authors.

However, little is known about the rapid adaptation to stimulus duration. In this study, we investigated whether the duration aftereffect could also be induced by short-term adaptation to stimuli of both sub- and supra-second durations. To control for the internal reference for duration judgment, participants were adapted to a stimulus of medium duration, and then tested with both longer and shorter stimuli. We found that the duration aftereffect was only observed after long-term adaptation to stimuli of both sub- and supra-second durations, which suggests that the exposure time to the adaptor is a fundamental factor in determining the duration aftereffect. Our findings offer further evidence of the duration aftereffect, which in this study was dissociated from the anchor effect and high-level aftereffects. © 2017 Li, Xiao, Yin, Liu and Huang.",0.40397350993377484

Methods: We explored the factor structure of the EDE-Q and examined the internal consistency of the derived scales for Japanese participants (Study I), the convergent validity with other eating disorder-related psychological measures (Study II) and the distinction between the derived two body image-related factors with psychological measures (StudyIII). The EDE-Q was administered to 1,430 undergraduate students in Study I and in Study II was subsequently assessed by two self-report measures of eating pathology, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) for 558 undergraduate students and the Eating Disorders Inventory-II (EDI-II) 111. In StudyIII, another 225 undergraduate students participated in an examination of the relationships of the derived body image-related subscales of the EDE-Q with the psychological measures of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Public Self-Consciousness Scale, and Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale. Results: Exploratory factor analysis of the EDE-Q identified four meaningful factors. Of the original four EDE-Q factors, ""Restriction"" and ""Eating Concern"" were retained. However, the other two factors, ""Shape"" and ""Weight"" Concerns, were combined into two different factors: ""Fear of Obesity"" and ""Self-Esteem Based on Shape and Weight"". Internal consistency of the derived four factors was adequate, and the relationships with EDI-II and EAT-26 measures demonstrated convergent validity. Analysis of the distinction between ""Fear of Obesity"" and ""Self-Esteem Based on Shape and Weight"" revealed that only ""Self-Esteem Based on Shape and Weight"" was significantly associated with the measures assessing psychopathology related to eating disorders. Conclusions: This study describes restructured factors of the EDE-Q that were tested with undergraduate students.

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of functional connectivity (FC) between the bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) after acupuncture intervention in right subcortical stroke patients. Twenty right-hemispheric subcortical stroke patients and 20 healthy subjects were recruited to undergo one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. The scanning consisted of resting-state fMRI before and after needling at Yanglinquan (GB34), and task-evoked fMRI. The most significant active point during the left passive thumb-to-index task was chosen as the seed point. The seed-based FC analysis of the bilateral M1s was performed. Stroke patients revealed decreased FC between the bilateral M1s compared with healthy subjects, and the decreased FC was significantly enhanced after acupuncture at GB34. Acupuncture could increase the intrinsically decreased FC between the bilateral M1s which provided further insight into the neural mechanisms of acupuncture for motor function recovery in stroke patients. © 2017 Ning, Li, Fu, Ren, Zhang, Liu, Cui and Zou.",0.39779005524861877

In the present research, we conducted 4 experiments to investigate causal superlearning, a phenomenon in human causal learning analogous to superconditioning. Experiment 1 demonstrated superlearning relative to appropriate control conditions. Experiment 2 showed that superlearning wanes when the number of cues used in an experiment is relatively large. Experiment 3 determined that even when relatively many cues are used, superlearning can be observed provided testing is conducted immediately after training, which is problematic for explanations by most contemporary learning theories. Experiment 4 found that ratings of a superlearning cue are weaker than those to the training excitor which gives basis to the conditioned inhibitor-like causal preventor used during causal superlearning training. This is inconsistent with the prediction by propositional reasoning accounts of causal cue competition, but is readily explained by associative learning models. In sum, the current experiments revealed some weaknesses of both the associative and propositional reasoning models with respect to causal superlearning. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0.40425531914893614

Tuition-free candidates are of the focus of many researchers; however, no study reports how tuition-free teacher candidates think about teachers. The present study explored stereotypes about middle school and university teachers held by teacher candidates. Specifically, we looked for the differences between the stereotypes held by the teacher candidates and general undergraduates. This study attempted to provide a potential tool to predict the actual willingness of teacher candidates to work as middle school teachers. University and middle school teachers were evaluated using descriptive phrases or words on a five-point Likert scale by 116 tuition-free teacher candidates and 155 general undergraduates. Exploratory factor analyses revealed a three-factor stereotype model including occupational cognition, occupational personality, and occupational emotion. Compared with general undergraduates, teacher candidates held more positive occupational personality and emotions toward middle school teachers; they held more negative occupational emotions toward university teachers. Further, the undergraduates' willingness to be middle school teachers positively correlated with positive occupational emotions and negatively correlated with negative occupational personality and emotions toward middle school teachers. This supported previous studies that individuals' professional willingness were influenced by their stereotypes about professions. © 2017 Zuo, Zhao, Peng and Chen.",0.5117370892018779

Together with the upcoming total synaptic connectome of the Drosophila nervous systemand the possibilities of single-cell-specific transgene expression, it offers enticing opportunities for research. Indeed, the paradigmhas already been adopted by a number of labs and is robust enough to be used for teaching in classroom settings. This has given rise to a demand for a detailed, hands-on manual directed at newcomers and/or at laboratory novices, and this is what we here provide. The paradigm and the present manual have a unique set of features: • The paradigm is cheap, easy, and robust; • The manual is detailed enough for newcomers or laboratory novices; • It briefly covers the essential scientific context; • It includes sheets for scoring, data analysis, and display; • It is multilingual: in addition to an English version we provide German, French, Japanese, Spanish and Italian language versions as well. The present manual can thus foster science education at an earlier age and enable research by a broader community than has been the case to date. © 2017 Michels, Saumweber, Biernacki, Thum, Glasgow, Schleyer, Chen, Eschbach, Stocker, Toshima, Tanimura, Louis, Arias-Gil, Marescotti, Benfenati and Gerber.",0.4117647058823529
Emotion Perception Mediates the Predictive Relationship Between Verbal Ability and Functional Outcome in High-Functioning Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder,2017,30,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012305751&doi=10.1007%2fs10803-017-3036-1&partnerID=40&md5=60d9ba0087297c1b3e54174d01f4a99c,"The aim of this study was to identify specific cognitive abilities that predict functional outcome in high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and to clarify the contribution of those abilities and their relationships. In total, 41 adults with ASD performed cognitive tasks in a broad range of neuro- and social cognitive domains, and information concerning functional outcomes was obtained. Regression analyses revealed that emotion perception and verbal generativity predicted adaptive functioning directly, and the former mediated between the other two. These findings provide the first evidence of a triadic relationship among neuro- and social cognition and functional outcome in this population. Our results suggest that psychosocial interventions targeting these cognitive abilities could benefit social adaptation in adults with ASD. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.4793388429752066

This study attempts to build a meta-theory and to demonstrate empirical designs for Gih, discussing the problems of the mind and body, or the subject and object, compared with the concept of ""affordance"" proposed by ecological approaches. The notion of Gih extends beyond that of affordance in that Gih activates a psychosomatic process between the physical condition and the mental state that facilitates the bi-directional interactions between subject and object. Therefore, the concept of Gih integrates mind and body, providing a means of comparing Eastern and Western philosophical systems. © 2017 Lee, Shaw and Jin.",0.4076923076923077

We performed this multi-class classification study on selected subjects from the publically available attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD-200 dataset of patients and healthy children. The dataset has three groups, namely, ADHD inattentive, ADHD combined, and typically developing. We calculated the global averaged functional connectivity maps across the whole cortex to extract anatomical atlas parcellation based features from the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data and cortical parcellation based features from the structural MRI (sMRI) data. In addition, the preprocessed image volumes from both of these modalities followed an ANOVA analysis separately using all the voxels. This study utilized the average measure from the most significant regions acquired from ANOVA as features for classification in addition to the multi-modal and multi-measure features of structural and functional MRI data. We extracted most discriminative features by hierarchical sparse feature elimination and selection algorithm. These features include cortical thickness, image intensity, volume, cortical thickness standard deviation, surface area, and ANOVA based features respectively. An extreme learning machine performed both the binary and multi-class classifications in comparison with support vector machines. This article reports prediction accuracy of both unimodal and multi-modal features from test data. We achieved 76.190% (p < 0.0001) classification accuracy in multi-class settings as well as 92.857% (p < 0.0001) classification accuracy in binary settings. In addition, we found ANOVA-based significant regions of the brain that also play a vital role in the classification of ADHD. Thus, from a clinical perspective, this multi-modal group analysis approach with multi-measure features may improve the accuracy of the ADHD differential diagnosis. © 2017 Qureshi, Oh, Min, Jo and Lee.",0.48120300751879697
Impaired activation of visual attention network for motion salience is accompanied by reduced functional connectivity between frontal eye fields and visual cortex in strabismic amblyopia,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018311054&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00195&partnerID=40&md5=70cd5197495313550dfdb41e36c67158,"Strabismic amblyopia is now acknowledged to be more than a simple loss of acuity and to involve alterations in visually driven attention, though whether this applies to both stimulus-driven and goal-directed attention has not been explored. Hence we investigated monocular threshold performance during a motion salience-driven attention task involving detection of a coherent dot motion target in one of four quadrants in adult controls and those with strabismic amblyopia. Psychophysical motion thresholds were impaired for the strabismic amblyopic eye, requiring longer inspection time and consequently slower target speed for detection compared to the fellow eye or control eyes. We compared fMRI activation and functional connectivity between four ROIs of the occipital-parieto-frontal visual attention network [primary visual cortex (V1), motion sensitive area V5, intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and frontal eye fields (FEF)], during a suprathreshold version of the motion-driven attention task, and also a simple goal-directed task, requiring voluntary saccades to targets randomly appearing along a horizontal line. Activation was compared when viewed monocularly by controls and the amblyopic and its fellow eye in strabismics. BOLD activation was weaker in IPS, FEF and V5 for both tasks when viewing through the amblyopic eye compared to viewing through the fellow eye or control participants' non-dominant eye. No difference in V1 activation was seen between the amblyopic and fellow eye, nor between the two eyes of control participants during the motion salience task, though V1 activation was significantly less through the amblyopic eye than through the fellow eye and control group non-dominant eye viewing during the voluntary saccade task. Functional correlations of ROIs within the attention network were impaired through the amblyopic eye during the motion salience task, whereas this was not the case during the voluntary saccade task. Specifically, FEF showed reduced functional connectivity with visual cortical nodes during the motion salience task through the amblyopic eye, despite suprathreshold detection performance. This suggests that the reduced ability of the amblyopic eye to activate the frontal components of the attention networks may help explain the aberrant control of visual attention and eye movements in amblyopes. © 2017 Wang, Crewther, Liang, Laycock, Yu, Alexander, Crewther,Wang and Yin.",0.38857142857142857

Although the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments remain unclear, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) hypofunctioning in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated. Moreover, cognitive symptoms in SCZ are usually unresponsive to treatment with current antipsychotics and by onset, disruption of the dopamine system, not NMDAR hypofunctioning, dominates the symptoms. Therefore, treating cognitive deficits at an early stage is a realistic approach. In this study, we tested whether an early treatment targeting mGluR2 would be effective in ameliorating cognitive impairments in the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) model of SCZ. We investigated the effects of an mGluR2 agonist/mGluR3 antagonist, LY395756 (LY39), on the NMDAR expression and function in juveniles, as well as cognitive deficits in adult rats after juvenile treatment. We found that gestational MAM exposure induced a significant decrease in total protein levels of the NMDAR subunit, NR2B, and a significant increase of pNR2BTyr1472 in the juvenile rat PFC. Treatment with LY39 in juvenile MAM-exposed rats effectively recovered the disrupted NMDAR expression. Furthermore, a subchronic LY39 treatment in juvenile MAM-exposed rats also alleviated the learning deficits and cognitive flexibility impairments when tested with a cross-maze based set-shifting task in adults. Therefore, our study demonstrates that targeting dysfunctional NMDARs with an mGluR2 agonist during the early stage of SCZ could be an effective strategy in preventing the development and progression in addition to ameliorating cognitive impairments of SCZ. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.3155737704918033

A total of 530 students from an elementary school and a middle school in China were asked to complete the measures assessing two predictors of TPB: attitude and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Next, they completed a survey about their choice intention between playing an online game and doing homework in three different situations, wherein a conflict between playing online games and doing homework was introduced and subjective norm was manipulated as peers supporting and parents objecting to playing online games. The results showed that adolescents' attitude and PBC, as well as the perception of obtaining or not obtaining support from their peers and caregivers (manipulated subjective norm), significantly influenced their choice intention in online gaming situations. These findings contribute to the understanding of the factors affecting adolescents' online gaming, which has been a concern of both caregivers and educators. With regard to the theoretical implications, this study extended previous work by providing evidence that TPB can be applied to analyze choice intention. Moreover, this study illuminated the effects of the separating factors of subjective norm on choice intention between playing online games and studying. © 2017 Wang, Liu, Ding, Liu, Xu and Zhen.",0.4155844155844156

Following this more introductory section, we argue why individual differences in primary emotional systems may represent the phylogenetically oldest parts of human personality. Our argumentation leads to the need to increasingly consider individual differences in the raw affects/emotions of people to understand human personality in a bottom-up fashion, which can be coordinated with top-down perspectives. In support of this idea, we also review existing evidence linking individual differences in primal emotions as assessed with the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales and the widely accepted Big Five Model of Personality. In this context, we provide additional evidence on the link between primal emotions and personality in German and Chinese sample populations. In short, this article addresses evolutionary perspectives in the evaluation of human personality, highlighting some of the ancestral emotional urges that probably still control variations in the construction of human personality structures. Moreover, we address how individual differences in primary emotional systems can illuminate linkages to major human psychopathologies and the potential advantages and disadvantages of carrying a certain personality trait within certain cultural/environmental niches. © 2017 Montag and Panksepp.",0.5276381909547738

Inhibition of return (IOR) is a mechanism by which orienting to a previously attended location or object is inhibited. In two experiments, we examined whether categories of real-life objects modify IOR. In Experiment 1, familiar objects (faces, hands, feet, chairs, and flowers) and a nonsense control object (a square) were presented as cues and participants were asked to detect a target presented either in a cued or uncued position. Body parts were examined since they have often been shown to influence visual selective attention. Results showed substantial IOR irrespective of cue object category. However, IOR decreased very rapidly, even in trials with a control cue. This atypical time course was not observed when only the control cue was used (Experiment 2). We concluded that the presence of various familiar objects in Experiment 1 acted as a context and modified observers’ attentional sets. The results suggest that IOR in real-life scenes with familiar objects is different from IOR observed in typical experimental settings. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

Effects of behavioural activation on the neural basis of other perspective self-referential processing in subthreshold depression: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84997683964&doi=10.1017%2fS0033291716002956&partnerID=40&md5=fe109212c5007f66b826c39e72cb7b6d,"Background: It has been demonstrated that negatively distorted self-referential processing, in which individuals evaluate one's own self, is a pathogenic mechanism in subthreshold depression that has a considerable impact on the quality of life and carries an elevated risk of developing major depression. Behavioural activation (BA) is an effective intervention for depression, including subthreshold depression. However, brain mechanisms underlying BA are not fully understood. We sought to examine the effect of BA on neural activation during other perspective self-referential processing in subthreshold depression. Method: A total of 56 subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans during a self-referential task with two viewpoints (self/other) and two emotional valences (positive/negative) on two occasions. Between scans, while the intervention group (n = 27) received BA therapy, the control group (n = 29) did not. Results: The intervention group showed improvement in depressive symptoms, increased activation in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and increased reaction times during other perspective self-referential processing for positive words after the intervention. Also, there was a positive correlation between increased activation in the dmPFC and improvement of depressive symptoms. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between improvement of depressive symptoms and increased reaction times. Conclusions: BA increased dmPFC activation during other perspective self-referential processing with improvement of depressive symptoms and increased reaction times which were associated with improvement of self-monitoring function. Our results suggest that BA improved depressive symptoms and objective monitoring function for subthreshold depression. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2016.",0.3924050632911392

Social interaction affects neural outcomes of sign language learning as a foreign language in adults,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018313103&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00115&partnerID=40&md5=9eb4efa82d30c64b98bc9cbe0db20d27,"Children naturally acquire a language in social contexts where they interact with their caregivers. Indeed, research shows that social interaction facilitates lexical and phonological development at the early stages of child language acquisition. It is not clear, however, whether the relationship between social interaction and learning applies to adult second language acquisition of syntactic rules. Does learning second language syntactic rules through social interactions with a native speaker or without such interactions impact behavior and the brain? The current study aims to answer this question. Adult Japanese participants learned a new foreign language, Japanese sign language (JSL), either through a native deaf signer or via DVDs. Neural correlates of acquiring new linguistic knowledge were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants in each group were indistinguishable in terms of their behavioral data after the instruction. The fMRI data, however, revealed significant differences in the neural activities between two groups. Significant activations in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were found for the participants who learned JSL through interactions with the native signer. In contrast, no cortical activation change in the left IFG was found for the group who experienced the same visual input for the same duration via the DVD presentation. Given that the left IFG is involved in the syntactic processing of language, spoken or signed, learning through social interactions resulted in an fMRI signature typical of native speakers: activation of the left IFG. Thus, broadly speaking, availability of communicative interaction is necessary for second language acquisition and this results in observed changes in the brain. © 2017 Yusa, Kim, Koizumi, Sugiura and Kawashima.",0.4188679245283019

Previous research suggests that walking speed and step length may predictably influence the extent of this CoM control. Here we ask how stable this control is. We altered treadmill walking speed by systematically increasing or decreasing it at fixed intervals. We then reversed direction. We hypothesized that the control of the CoM vertical velocity during the late stance of the walking gait may serve as an order parameter which has an attribute of hysteresis. The presence of hysteresis implies that the CoM control is not based on simply knowing the current input conditions to predict the output response. Instead, there is also the influence of previous speed conditions on the ongoing responses. We found that the magnitudes of CoM control were different depending on whether the treadmill speed (as the control parameter) was ramped up or down. Changes in step length also influenced CoM control. A stronger effect was observed when the treadmill speed was speeded up compared to down. However, the effect of speed direction remained significant after controlling for step length. The hysteresis effect of CoM control as a function of speed history demonstrated in the current study suggests that the regulation of CoM vertical velocity during late stance is influenced by previous external conditions and constraints which combine to influence the desired behavioral outcome. © 2017 Lee and Chong.",0.3333333333333333

They find strong support for the existence of the disposition effect as an independent hypothesis. This is an improvement over previous studies, which tested this hypothesis only jointly with others. The authors' results also strongly point to diminishing sensitivity, of the type postulated by prospect theory, being positively associated with the disposition effect. © 2017 The Institute of Behavioral Finance.",0.5283018867924528

Recent studies have shown that oxytocin may modulate social recognition in both sexes, and thus it may be related to empathy. Brain regions that are associated with social recognition and empathy (e.g., the insular cortex) are activated in the rubber hand illusion (RHI), which involves illusory ownership of a rubber hand caused by brush strokes applied synchronously to both a rubber hand and one of the participant's hand, which is hidden from view. It is intriguing to examine whether oxytocin modulates plastic changes in body representation, such as the changes occurring in the RHI. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between salivary oxytocin concentration and the feeling of rubber hand ownership. Brush strokes were applied synchronously or asynchronously to the participant's hand and a rubber hand on different days. Salivary oxytocin was measured before and after the behavioral tasks. We found that participants who had high concentrations of salivary oxytocin tended to feel strong ownership of the rubber hand. We also found that the participants with a high autism spectrum quotient (AQ) score who particularly felt difficulties in social skills and communications tended to feel weak rubber hand ownership. We observed that illusory body ownership was closely linked to social communications and a related neuroendocrine basis. The results of the present study suggest that an individual's salivary oxytocin concentration can predict the extent to which the individual experiences the RHI; furthermore, oxytocin might modulate the sensation of body ownership. © 2017 Ide and Wada.",0.3783783783783784

Instead of exerting load over the whole block of number judgment trials, in this dual task, number judgment trials were inserted into each interstimulus interval of an n-back task, which served as the working memory load. We varied both load type (verbal and spatial) and amount (1-load, 2-load, and 3-load). The results indicated that the SNARC effect disappeared even under the 1-load condition for a parity judgment, regardless of the type of load. However, during the magnitude comparison task, the SNARC effect increased with increasing load amounts under spatial load conditions; under verbal load conditions, the SNARC effect decreased with increasing amounts of load, and disappeared during the 3-load task. The difference between the parity and magnitude tasks was not attributable to the interval stimuli or task switching. These findings confirm that different spatial–numerical associations for comparing numerical magnitudes and judgments of parity have different needs with respect to working memory resources. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.47593582887700536
Neurophysiological evidence of compensatory brain mechanisms underlying attentional-related processes in symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018182990&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00550&partnerID=40&md5=0f345aa6d98ad2fe6b024cb6048030d7,"A recent electrophysiological study suggests existing compensatory brain activity as a mechanism for functional recovery of visual attention detection (the capacity for detecting external cues) in symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients. Despite such evidence, little is known about other aspects of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission, such as their capacity to concentrate on the task at hands without being interfered by distracting information. To this end, we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from 20 symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy controls while they engaged in a classic Stroop task. Symptomatically remitted patients showed comparable Stroop interference to healthy controls, indicating a degree of functional recovery of such a capacity in these patients. On the neural level, the N450 over the fronto-central and central regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict detection, was found across both groups, although patients presented a reduced N450 relative to healthy controls. By contrast, the amplitude of the sustained potential (SP) (600-800 ms) over the parieto-central and parietal regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict resolution, was significantly increased in patients relative to healthy controls. Furthermore, such increased SP amplitude correlated positively with improved behavioral accuracy in symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia. These findings reveal that symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia increasingly recruited the parietal activity involving successful conflict resolution to offset reduced conflict detection. Therefore, this provides further insight into compensatory mechanisms potentially involving a degree of functional recovery of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission. © 2017 Chen, Ding, Zhang, Cui, Jiang and Li.",0.45634920634920634

Of all participants, 21.0% had dropped out of treatment and 27.7% exhibited poor adherence during the study period. Adjusting for significant background variables, use of at least one type of club drugs [hazards ratio (HR) = 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01–3.56] and use of methamphetamine in the last six months (HR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.15–4.43) significantly predicted dropout. Frequency of having six or more drinks on one drinking occasion when drinking [relative risk (RR) = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.16–2.95] significantly predicted poor adherence. Our findings indicated that club drugs and alcohol abuse predicted dropout and poor adherence among MMT patients. Early identification and intervention for the abuse should be taken into consideration when developing interventions tailored to improve treatment outcomes among MMT patients. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.5486381322957199
The optimal speed for cortical activation of passive wrist movements performed by a rehabilitation robot: A functional NIRS study,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018366197&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00194&partnerID=40&md5=a9f4bbf79e6bc29991c4e478b893758e,"Objectives: To advance development of rehabilitation robots, the conditions to induce appropriate brain activation during rehabilitation performed by robots should be optimized, based on the concept of brain plasticity. In this study, we examined differences in cortical activation according to the speed of passive wrist movements performed by a rehabilitation robot. Methods: Twenty three normal subjects participated in this study. Passive movements of the right wrist were performed by the wrist rehabilitation robot at three different speeds: 0.25 Hz; slow, 0.5 Hz; moderate and 0.75 Hz; fast. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure the brain activity accompanying the passive movements performed by a robot. The relative changes in oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) were measured in two regions of interest (ROI): the primary sensory-motor cortex (SM1) and premotor area (PMA). Results: In the left SM1 the HbO value was significantly higher at 0.5 Hz, compared with movements performed at 0.25 Hz and 0.75 Hz (p < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in the left PMA (p > 0.05). In the group analysis, the left SM1 was activated during passive movements at three speeds (uncorrected p < 0.05) and the greatest activation in the SM1 was observed at 0.5 Hz. Conclusions: In conclusion, the contralateral SM1 showed the greatest activation by a moderate speed (0.5 Hz) rather than slow (0.25 Hz) and fast (0.75 Hz) speed. Our results suggest an ideal speed for execution of the wrist rehabilitation robot. Therefore, our results might provide useful data for more effective and empirically-based robot rehabilitation therapy. © 2017 Bae, Jang, Seo and Chang.",0.39669421487603307
Eye Movements Converge on Vanishing Points during Visual Search,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017225148&doi=10.1111%2fjpr.12144&partnerID=40&md5=357b1d96b58df83a000fff96001a56a7,"The vanishing point seems to be a useful cue for understanding scenes at a glance. The closer the objects are, the smaller their sizes become. Because the resolution of central vision is higher than that of peripheral vision, seeing a vanishing point enables individuals to perceive the whole scene. Here, we examined whether vanishing points attract eye movements during visual search. In Experiment 1, we conducted a free-viewing task to examine whether vanishing points play a significant role. In Experiment 2, the participants searched for a Gabor patch that was embedded in manmade or natural scenes. In Experiment 3, to investigate the robustness of the vanishing point effect, visual search was conducted using simpler geometric backgrounds. We observed that eye movements converged around vanishing points, and that the first fixations are also located around them. These results suggest that vanishing points as well as salient locations can capture eye movements, and eye movements are guided by such environmental structures. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

Early identification of candidate application areas will allow for timely adjustment of technology innovation strategies and minimization of risks at firm level. This paper proposes a framework of application areas forecasting process for disruptive technology based on patent data. SIRS epidemic model is analogically introduced by measuring transition velocity of all the entities in the technology diffusion system respectively. We implement the model deterministically to forecast the potential of industrial and technological disruption in the short run, and stochastically to forecast the disruptive technology's major outbreak in candidate application areas in the long run. Radio-frequency identification technology is selected as case study. We conclude by discussing the major outbreak probabilities and potential disruptions of RFID in three different application areas. The results will provide practical suggestion to firms and other stakeholders to facilitate their strategy making when faced with disruptive technologies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.5370370370370371
Designing an intelligent decision support system for effective negotiation pricing: A systematic and learning approach,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013223041&doi=10.1016%2fj.dss.2017.02.003&partnerID=40&md5=ee7035c473a71cb2c7ebb5392d96d42a,"Automatic negotiation pricing and differential pricing aim to provide different customers with products/services that adequately meet their requirements at the “right” price. This often takes place with the purchase of expensive products/services and in the business-to-business context. Effective negotiation pricing can help enhance a company's profitability, balance supply and demand, and improve the customer satisfaction. However, determining the “right” price is a rather complex decision-making problem that puzzles pricing managers, as it needs to consider information from many constituents of the purchase channel. To further advance this line of research, this study proposes a systematic and learning approach that consists of three different types of fuzzy systems (FSs) to provide intelligent decision support for negotiation pricing. More specifically, the three FSs include: 1) a standard FS, which is a typical multiple inputs and single output FS that forms a mathematical mapping from the input space to the output space; 2) an SFS-SISOM, which is a linear fuzzy inference model with a single input and a single output module; and 3) a hierarchical FS, which consists of several FSs in a hierarchical manner to perform fuzzy inference. To address the existing problem of a standard FS suffering from the high-dimensional problem with a large number of influential factors, a generalized type of FS (named hierarchical FS), including its mathematical models and suitability for tackling the negotiation pricing problem, is introduced. In particular, a proof-of-concept prototype system that integrates these three FSs is also developed and presented. From a system design perspective, this artifact provides immense potential and flexibility for end users to choose the most suitable model for the given problem. The utility and effectiveness of this proposed system is illustrated and examined by three experimental datasets that vary from dimensionality and data coverage. Moreover, the performances of three different approaches are compared and discussed with respect to some important properties of decision support systems (DSSs). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.5222929936305732
Implicit Learning of Spatial Configuration Occurs without Eye Movement,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013191565&doi=10.1111%2fjpr.12147&partnerID=40&md5=db9741ab915b222e526d5220abc03fe7,"Studies have demonstrated that eye movements enhance visual memory. However, the role of eye movement in implicit learning is not clear. We investigated whether implicit learning of spatial configuration requires eye movement using the contextual cueing paradigm. Eye movements were restricted by instructing participants to maintain fixation on the center of a display during a visual search. The results demonstrated that contextual cueing occurs even without eye movements. Furthermore, contextual cueing effects were obtained more rapidly when eye movements were restricted compared to when eye movements were allowed. The findings suggest that eye movements mediate the learning progress in contextual cueing: stabilization of spatial layout representation by restriction of eye movements induces a rapid learning of configuration. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

Patterns and correlates of major depression in Chinese adults: A cross-sectional study of 0.5 million men and women,2017,65,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85002002711&doi=10.1017%2fS0033291716002889&partnerID=40&md5=3937fd83e8f0d6543ef0721e4247fbee,"Background: Worldwide 350 million people suffer from major depression, with the majority of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. We examined the patterns, correlates and care-seeking behaviour of adults suffering from major depressive episode (MDE) in China. Method: A nationwide study recruited 512 891 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 provinces across China during 2004-2008. The 12-month prevalence of MDE was assessed by the Modified Composite International Diagnostic Interview-short form. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of MDE associated with socio-economic, lifestyle and health-related factors and major stressful life events. Results: Overall, 0.7% of participants had MDE and a further 2.4% had major depressive symptoms. Stressful life events were strongly associated with MDE [adjusted OR 14.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.7-15.7], with a dose-response relationship with the number of such events experienced. Family conflict had the highest OR for MDE (18.9, 95% CI 16.8-21.2) among the 10 stressful life events. The risk of MDE was also positively associated with rural residency (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.7), low income (OR 2.3, 95% CI 2.1-2.4), living alone (OR 2.6, 95% CI 2.3-3.0), smoking (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) and certain other mental disorders (e.g. anxiety, phobia). Similar, albeit weaker, associations were observed with depressive symptoms. Among those with MDE, about 15% sought medical help or took psychiatric medication, 15% reported having suicidal ideation and 6% reported attempting suicide. Conclusions: Among Chinese adults, the patterns and correlates of MDE were generally consistent with those observed in the West. The low rates of seeking professional help and treatment highlight the great gap in mental health services in China. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2016.",0.425

In this paper, we examine the link between weight, height and well-being for three distinct samples in China given that attractiveness effects likely vary greatly across sociocultural contexts. As China has recently undergone rapid economic transformation in the urban areas, this empirical exercise is particularly interesting because it can highlight how changing social norms have affected the relationship between physical appearance and subjective well-being. For the rural and migrant samples, we find that for both men and women, big and tall individuals have higher levels of well-being. This is consistent with the notion that the strong are better off when more labor intensive work is the norm. For the urban sample and for urban males in particular, no well-being penalty is found for being obese, unlike previous results based on Western samples. It is very likely that the unique Chinese cultural practice of network building banquets and feasting is behind this finding. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0.49710982658959535
Adult attachment styles associated with brain activity in response to infant faces in nulliparous women: An event-related potentials study,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018257625&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00627&partnerID=40&md5=68cf4229e2d1c6066b13883e2f4c82eb,"Adult attachment style is a key for understanding emotion regulation and feelings of security in human interactions as well as for the construction of the caregiving system. The caregiving system is a group of representations about affiliative behaviors, which is guided by the caregiver's sensitivity and empathy, and is mature in young adulthood. Appropriate perception and interpretation of infant emotions is a crucial component of the formation of a secure attachment relationship between infant and caregiver. As attachment styles influence the ways in which people perceive emotional information, we examined how different attachment styles associated with brain response to the perception of infant facial expressions in nulliparous females with secure, anxious, and avoidant attachment styles. The event-related potentials of 65 nulliparous females were assessed during a facial recognition task with joy, neutral, and crying infant faces. The results showed that anxiously attached females exhibited larger N170 amplitudes than those with avoidant attachment in response to all infant faces. Regarding the P300 component, securely attached females showed larger amplitudes to all infant faces in comparison with avoidantly attached females. Moreover, anxiously attached females exhibited greater amplitudes than avoidantly attached females to only crying infant faces. In conclusion, the current results provide evidence that attachment style differences are associated with brain responses to the perception of infant faces. Furthermore, these findings further separate the psychological mechanisms underlying the caregiving behavior of those with anxious and avoidant attachment from secure attachment. © 2017 Ma, Ran, Chen, Ma and Hu.",0.5102880658436214
Dull to social acceptance rather than sensitivity to social ostracism in interpersonal interaction for depression: Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence from cyberball tasks,2017,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018252851&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00162&partnerID=40&md5=654c8e9c04eb46efd7b805148a9b76a0,"Objectives: Impairments in interpersonal relationships in depression present as irritability, pessimism, and withdrawal, and play an important role in the onset and maintenance of the disorder. However, we know little about the neurological causes of this impaired interpersonal function. This study used the event-related brain potential (ERP) version of the Cyberball paradigm to investigate the emotions and neural activities in depressive patients during social inclusion and exclusion simultaneously to explore neuropsychological mechanisms. Methods: Electrophysiological data were recorded when 27 depressed patients and 23 healthy controls (HCs) performed a virtual ball tossing game (Cyberball) during which the participants believed they were playing with two other co-players over the internet. The Cyberball paradigm included two other conditions; inclusion during which participants received the ball with the same probability as the other players to experience a feeling of acceptance, and exclusion during which the participants experienced a feeling of ostracism when the other two players threw the ball with each other. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was used as a baseline and after each block during the Cyberball to assess positive and negative effects. In addition, a brief Need-Threat Scale (NTS) was used to assess the fulfillment of basic needs of subjects after each block and 10 min after ostracism. Moreover, the relationship between the ERP data of depression and clinical symptoms was analyzed. Results: Exclusion compared to inclusion Cyberball caused a decrease in positive affect and an increase in negative affect. The group differences were only found in the positive affect. Moreover, patients reported a lower level of basic needs than did HCs after social inclusion, but a similar level of basic needs after social exclusion. At the electrophysiological level, patients showed decreased P3 amplitudes compared to HCs in social inclusion, and P3 amplitudes were borderline negatively correlated with their scores of anhedonia symptoms. Limitations: A limitation of our study was that the subjects' criteria were different. Conclusions: The behavioral and electrophysiological results indicated that the interpersonal problems in depressive patients were mainly due to deficits in processing the pleasurable social stimuli rather than aversive social cues. © 2017 Zhang, Li, Wang, Zhou, Dong, Zhang, Xie, Mu, Li, Zhu and Yu.",0.38764044943820225

To establish a credible baseline and evaluate impacts of potential new policies, this analysis employs multiple methods to forecast residential PV deployment in California, including a time-series forecasting model, a threshold heterogeneity diffusion model, a Bass diffusion model, and National Renewable Energy Laboratory's dSolar model. As a baseline, the residential PV market in California is modeled to peak in the early 2020s, with a peak annual installation of 1.5–2 GW across models. We then use the baseline results from the dSolar model and the threshold model to gauge the impact of the recent federal investment tax credit (ITC) extension, the newly approved California net energy metering (NEM) policy, and a hypothetical value-of-solar (VOS) compensation scheme. We find that the recent ITC extension may increase annual PV installations by 12%–18% (roughly 500 MW, MW) for the California residential sector in 2019–2020. The new NEM policy only has a negligible effect in California due to the relatively small new charges (< 100 MW in 2019–2020). Furthermore, impacts of the VOS compensation scheme ($0.12 per kilowatt-hour) are larger, reducing annual PV adoption by 32% (or 900–1300 MW) in 2019–2020. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.4230769230769231

Case presentation: A 63-year-old woman, who was diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis, became unresponsive with very little reaction to verbal contact after sequential life-threatening events, such as thrombosis of both pulmonary arteries and stenosis of the third portion of the duodenum, due to disease progression over 3 weeks beginning with oncological emergency hospital admission. Laboratory findings and electroencephalography were unremarkable. She maintained the position when the psycho-oncologist raised her hand (catalepsy). She had no medical history of psychiatric illness, or alcohol or drug abuse. From these findings, she was suspected of having a brief psychotic disorder with catalepsy and substupor, and 2.5 mg of haloperidol was administered. Her psychiatric symptoms disappeared in 4 days and the diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder was confirmed. Conclusions: Brief psychotic disorders can manifest in patients with cancer. Careful clinical assessment is needed to correctly diagnose patients with cancer who develop brief psychotic disorders and to identify those who will benefit from correct treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.39572192513368987

Methods: A total of 80 SD rats were randomly allocated into two pretreatment groups, including saline-pretreated group and sertraline-pretreated group. The sertraline-pretreated rats received sertraline and the saline-pretreated rats received saline for the past 4 weeks. Then, the two groups were randomly divided into four subgroups, respectively, including sham, MI, depression, and depression post-MI (MI + depression) subgroup. All animals were then sacrificed after 3 days to observe the effects of sertraline on levels of 5-HT, 5-HT 2A R, and SERT in the rat serum, platelet, and brain. Results: As compared with saline treatment group, serum 5-HT decreased significantly in sham subgroup and increase significantly in MI, depression, and MI-depression subgroups, platelet 5-HT increased significantly, brain 5-HT decreased significantly in the four subgroups after sertraline treatment (all P < 0.05). As compared with saline treatment group, platelet 5-HT 2A R decreased significantly in the sham subgroup and increased significantly in MI and depression subgroups, brain 5-HT 2A R increased significantly in MI subgroup and decreased significantly in depression and MI + depression subgroups after sertraline treatment (all P < 0.05). As compared with saline treatment group, serum SERT decreased significantly in the sham subgroup and increased significantly in depression subgroup, platelet SERT decreased significantly in the four subgroups and brain SERT increased significantly in sham and depression subgroups and decrease significantly in MI subgroup after sertraline treatment (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: Sertraline regulated 5-HT concentration of peripheral blood and brain according to 5-HT 2A R and SERT, thereby regulating the platelet function in various pathological states including MI, depression, and depression post-MI.  © 2017 Heart and Mind | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",0.4429065743944637

While Internet gaming disorder (IGD), conceptualized as a behavioral addiction, is lack of effective treatment practice and exploration of its mechanism. This research aims to test the effectiveness and detect the active ingredients of craving behavior intervention (CBI) in mitigation of IGD among young adults. A total of 63 male college students with IGD were assigned into the intervention group (six-session CBI intervention) or the waiting-list control group. Structured questionnaires were administered at pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2), 3-month follow-up (T3), and 6-month follow-up (T4). Compared to the control group, a significant decrease in the severity of IGD in intervention group was found at post-intervention and lasting to 6 months after intervention. The value changes of craving could partially mediate the relationship between intervention and changes of IGD among all effects tests (immediate, T2-T1; short-term, T3-T1; and long-term effects, T4-T1). Further, explorations of the active ingredients of intervention found depression relief and shift of psychological needs from Internet to real life significantly predict craving amelioration at both post-intervention and 6-month follow-up. Although preliminary, the current study provides evidence for the value of craving-aimed intervention practice in IGD treatment and identifies two potential active ingredients for mitigation of craving, and the long-term therapeutic benefits are further conferred. © 2017 Deng, Liu, Xia, Lan, Zhang and Fang.",0.40350877192982454

The participants in the study were 1,279 students (678 boys and 601 girls) from nine junior middle schools in Shenzhen, China. The initial stage of the research used a peer nomination questionnaire and a subjective well-being scale (used in previous studies) to collect data on the peer relationship networks and the subjective well-being of the students. Exponential random graph models were then used to explore the relationships between students with the aim of clarifying the character of the peer relationship networks and the influence of peer relationships on subjective well being. The results showed that all the adolescent peer relationship networks in our investigation had positive reciprocal effects, positive transitivity effects and negative expansiveness effects. However, none of the relationship networks had obvious receiver effects or leaders. The adolescents in partial peer relationship networks presented similar levels of subjective well-being on three dimensions (satisfaction with life, positive affects and negative affects) though not all network friends presented these similarities. The study shows that peer networks can affect an individual's subjective well-being. However, whether similarities among adolescents are the result of social influences or social choices needs further exploration, including longitudinal studies that investigate the potential processes of subjective well-being similarities among adolescents. © 2017 Jiao, Wang, Liu, Wu, Cui and Peng.",0.45064377682403434

Nevertheless, their interaction has rarely been examined. Thus, based on the fact that Asians are more intuitive in reasoning than Americans, we examined how this cultural difference might interact with age. Young and old participants from the US and Singapore performed a categorization task (living vs. non-living). To measure their reliance on intuition, we manipulated the typicality of targets (animate vs. inanimate). We showed that (1) RTs for inanimate organisms were slower than RTs for animate organisms (atypicality cost), (2) the cost was particularly large for older adults and (3) an age × culture interaction was observed such that cultural differences in the cost (Singaporeans > Americans) was found only among older participants. Further, we demonstrated that the age effect was associated with cognitive function and the culture effect among older adults was associated with cultural values. Finally, a moderated mediation analysis suggests that cognitive function and cultural values interact with each other in order to jointly influence one's cognition. © 2017 Na, Huang and Park.",0.48663101604278075

The results showed that, (1) children in Control condition merely adopted the lowest level of rule, the Weight Rule; (2) when they were either given feedback or the opportunity to operate the scale, they used a higher level rule, such as the Distance Rule, more frequently; and feedback was more effective than the operational experience was in promoting rule learning; (3) when they were allowed to operate the scale, and were simultaneously provided feedback, rule learning increased markedly, suggesting that feedback-based operation is the most efficient method for facilitating children's rule learning. © 2017 Li, Xie, Yang and Cao.",0.38666666666666666
The Neural Basis of Independence Versus Interdependence Orientations: A Voxel-Based Morphometric Analysis of Brain Volume,2017,33,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018393165&doi=10.1177%2f0956797616689079&partnerID=40&md5=8165dc2af1de6253e0478bdaeed55e82,"Sociocultural research has established independence and interdependence as two fundamental ways of thinking about oneself and the social world. Recent neuroscience studies further demonstrate that these orientations modulate brain activity in various self- and socially related tasks. In the current study, we explored whether the traits of independence and interdependence are reflected in anatomical variations in brain structure. We carried out structural brain imaging on a large sample of healthy participants (n = 265) who also completed self-report questionnaires of cultural orientations. Voxel-based morphometry analysis demonstrated that a relative focus of independence (vs. interdependence) was associated with increased gray-matter volume in a number of self-related regions, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex. These results provide novel insights into the biological basis of sociocultural orientations. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.46564885496183206
Two sides of emotion: Exploring positivity and negativity in six basic emotions across cultures,2017,71,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018179524&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00610&partnerID=40&md5=efc2419038d268963f853b0a711d47dc,"We employ a novel paradigm to test whether six basic emotions (sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and happiness; Ekman, 1992) contain both negativity and positivity, as opposed to consisting of a single continuum between negative and positive. We examined the perceived negativity and positivity of these emotions in terms of their affective and cognitive components among Korean, Chinese, Canadian, and American students. Assessing each emotion at the cognitive and affective levels cross-culturally provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the positivity and negativity of emotions. Affective components were rated as more divergent than cognitive components. Cross-culturally, Americans and Canadians gave higher valence ratings to the salient valence of each emotion, and lower ratings to the non-salient valence of an emotion, compared to Chinese and Koreans. The results suggest that emotions encompass both positivity and negativity, and there were cross-cultural differences in reported emotions. This paradigm complements existing emotion theories, building on past research and allowing for more parsimonious explanations of cross-cultural research on emotion. © 2017 An, Ji, Marks and Zhang.",0.4550898203592814

It is known that mass migration to the cities in China will affect family relations. However, few studies focused on the relationship between parenting styles and adolescents' mental health in migrant families. Thus, this study aimed to investigate how parenting styles could affect adolescent's social anxiety in migrant families. A total number of 1,345 adolescents in migrant families from four non-government-funded junior middle schools in Guangdong province formed the research sample. Parenting styles were measured using short-form of the Egna Minnen Beträffande Uppfostran, and social anxiety was evaluated using Social Anxiety Subscale of Self-Consciousness Scale. The results showed that emotional warmth, overprotection and rejection were significantly more often perceived from mothers than from fathers. Significant group differences between high social anxiety group and low social anxiety group were found in both father's rearing styles and mother's rearing styles. Furthermore, in migrant families, paternal emotional warmth could decrease adolescents' social anxiety, whereas maternal overprotection could increase it. © 2017 Xu, Ni, Ran and Zhang.",0.5170454545454546

The current study compared a broad array of behaviors across 21 countries (N = 5,522). Participants described their behavior at 7:00 p.m. the previous evening using the 68 items of the Riverside Behavioral Q-sort (RBQ). Correlations between average patterns of behavior in each country ranged from r =.69 to r =.97 and, in general, described a positive and relaxed activity. The most similar patterns were United States/Canada and least similar were Japan/United Arab Emirates (UAE). Similarities in behavior within countries were largest in Spain and smallest in the UAE. Further analyses correlated average RBQ item placements in each country with, among others, country-level value dimensions, personality traits, self-esteem levels, economic output, and population. Extroversion, openness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, self-esteem, happiness, and tolerant attitudes yielded more significant correlations than expected by chance. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0.43790849673202614

Accordingly, research testing whether perfectionism dimensions explain unique variance in these outcomes beyond neuroticism is needed. Research on cultural differences in perfectionism is also scarce. And it is especially unclear whether the link between perfectionism and psychological distress differs across individualistic and collectivistic cultures. Our study addressed these important gaps in knowledge. A sample of undergraduates from a traditionally individualistic culture (Canada; N = 449) and a traditionally collectivistic culture (China; N = 585) completed measures of self-oriented perfectionism, personal standards, socially prescribed perfectionism, concern over mistakes, doubts about actions, depression, anxiety, stress, and satisfaction with life. To test the incremental validity of perfectionism dimensions beyond neuroticism, as well as to test potential moderating effects of culture, four hierarchical regression analyses with interactions were conducted. Results supported the explanatory power of concern over mistakes and doubts about actions, beyond neuroticism and culture, in the prediction of depression, anxiety, and stress. As the first study to explore the incremental validity of perfectionism dimensions across undergraduates from traditionally individualistic and collectivistic cultures, our research both extends and clarifies understanding of the predictive power of perfectionism in important ways. ©2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",0.5482233502538071
Motion direction discrimination training reduces perceived motion repulsion,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007413751&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-016-1261-x&partnerID=40&md5=b7a7f770f09818561008c525bf4ce5e5,"Participants often exaggerate the perceived angular separation between two simultaneously presented motion stimuli, which is referred to as motion repulsion. The overestimation helps participants differentiate between the two superimposed motion directions, yet it causes the impairment of direction perception. Since direction perception can be refined through perceptual training, we here attempted to investigate whether the training of a direction discrimination task changes the amount of motion repulsion. Our results showed a direction-specific learning effect, which was accompanied by a reduced amount of motion repulsion both for the trained and the untrained directions. The reduction of the motion repulsion disappeared when the participants were trained on a luminance discrimination task (control experiment 1) or a speed discrimination task (control experiment 2), ruling out any possible interpretation in terms of adaptation or training-induced attentional bias. Furthermore, training with a direction discrimination task along a direction 150° away from both directions in the transparent stimulus (control experiment 3) also had little effect on the amount of motion repulsion, ruling out the contribution of task learning. The changed motion repulsion observed in the main experiment was consistent with the prediction of the recurrent model of perceptual learning. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that training in direction discrimination can benefit the precise direction perception of the transparent stimulus and provide new evidence for the recurrent model of perceptual learning. © 2016, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.43946188340807174
Assessment of upper limb motor dysfunction for children with cerebral palsy based on muscle synergy analysis,2017,37,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018346363&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00130&partnerID=40&md5=68d01c4eba5b806ee93e27f0d9741f79,"Muscle synergies are considered to be building blocks underlying motor behaviors. The goal of this study is to explore an objective and effective method to assess the upper limb motor dysfunction of cerebral palsy (CP) children from the aspect of muscle synergy analysis. Fourteen CP children and 10 typically developed (TD) children were recruited to perform three similar upper limb motion tasks related to the movements of elbow and shoulder joints, and surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals were recorded from 10 upper arm and shoulder muscles involved in the defined tasks. Non-negative matrix factorization algorithm was used to extract muscle synergies and the corresponding activation patterns during three similar tasks. For each subject in TD group, four muscle synergies were extracted in each task. Whereas, fewer mature synergies were recruited in CP group, and many abnormal synergy structures specific to CP group appeared. In view of neuromuscular control strategy differences, three synergy-related parameters were proposed and synergy structure similarity coefficient was found to have high ability in depicting the inter-subject similarity within task and the intra-subject similarity between tasks. Seven upper limb assessment (UPA) metrics, which were defined as the combinations of synergy structure similarity coefficients of three tasks, were proposed to assess the upper limb motor function of CP children. The experimental results demonstrated that these UPA metrics were able to assess upper limb motor function comprehensively and effectively. The proposed assessment method can serve as a promising approach to quantify the abnormality of muscle synergies, thus offering potential to derive a physiologically based quantitative index for assessing upper limb motor function in CP clinical diagnosis and rehabilitation. © 2017 Tang, Chen, Cao, Wu, Zhao and Zhang.",0.4652014652014652
Backward-walking biological motion orients attention to moving away instead of moving toward,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976465046&doi=10.3758%2fs13423-016-1083-9&partnerID=40&md5=0bffc5a6d1f877db0232f4347fe018cd,"Walking direction is an important attribute of biological motion because it carries key information, such as the specific intention of the walker. Although it is known that spatial attention is guided by walking direction, it remains unclear whether this attentional shift is reflexive (i.e., constantly shifts to the walking direction) or not. A richer interpretation of this effect is that attention is guided to seek the information that is necessary to understand the motion. To investigate this issue, we examined how backward-walking biological motion orients attention because the intention of walking backward is usually to avoid something that walking forward would encounter. The results showed that attention was oriented to the walking-away direction of biological motion instead of the walking-toward direction (Experiment 1), and this effect was not due to the gaze direction of biological motion (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that the attentional shift triggered by walking direction is not reflexive, thus providing support for the rich interpretation of these attentional effects. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4146341463414634
Prevalence of suicidal ideation and its association with positive affect in working women: A day reconstruction study,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016315439&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00285&partnerID=40&md5=18d8695307edf3def0ae9c76513f7953,"The suicide rate for females in China is the second highest worldwide, and China is the only country in the world in which the rate of suicides is higher for women than men. Affective instability has been shown to be a strong predictor of suicidal ideation, particularly among women. However, prior research has mainly focused on the impact of women's negative affect on suicidal ideation, ignoring the influence of positive affect on suicidal ideation. Studies have revealed that hopelessness, which is 1.3 times more important than depression for explaining suicidal ideation, is driven more by low levels of positive affect than by high levels of negative affect. Although positive affect has also been found to be related to suicidal ideation, and it demonstrates independent, beneficial effects on mental health, much remains to be learned about the association between positive affective instability and suicidal ideation. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese working women and explored the differences between working women with and without suicidal ideation in the intensity and daily variability of positive affect. A total of 222 young working women of ages 22-36 years (M = 27.64, SD = 3.73) were recruited from a free weekend psychology lecture. The women subsequently completed a daily diary Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) as well as a suicidal ideation questionnaire. We used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to analyze the data, and the results showed that: (1) 10.81% of participates reported suicidal ideation, the intensity of positive affect (happiness, warmth/friendliness, interest and relaxation/calmness) was significantly lower for women with suicidal ideation compared to women without suicidal ideation; (2) differing diurnal patterns of positive emotions were observed between women with and without suicidal ideation; women with suicidal ideation demonstrated a significantly lower trend of growth and a higher volatility in happiness, warmth/friendliness, relaxation/calmness. Given that lower intensity of positive affect and greater affective instability significantly predicted suicidal ideation in Chinese women, researchers should pay more attention to the role of positive affect in female suicide prevention research and intervention efforts in the future. © 2017 Tian, Yang, Yang and Huebner.",0.47619047619047616
Valuation of go stimuli or devaluation of no-go stimuli?

This phenomenon, known as the distractor devaluation effect also occurs when go/no-go tasks require response inhibition. However, it remains unclear whether there are interactions between attention and response controls when the distractor devaluation effect occurs. The aims of this study were to investigate whether attention to stimuli in the go/no-go task plays a facilitative role in distractor devaluation through response inhibition, and to clarify whether this effect reflects a decreased preference for no-go stimuli. Participants evaluated the preference for pictures before and after a go/no-go task. In Experiments 1 and 2, they made a go or no-go response depending on the category of pictures displayed (gummy candies or rice crackers), whereas in Experiment 3 they did on the basis digit category, even or odd numbers, superimposed on such pictures. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that the pictures presented as no-go stimuli in the preceding go/no-go task were evaluated as less positive than the pictures presented as go stimuli. This devaluation effect reflected an increased preference for the go stimuli but not a decreased preference for the no-go stimuli. Experiment 3 indicated that response inhibition did not affect the preference for the pictures that had not received attention in a preceding go/no-go task. These results suggest that although attention plays an important role in differential ratings for go and no-go stimuli, such differences, in fact, reflect the valuation of go stimuli. © 2017 Inoue and Sato.",0.41735537190082644
Perceptual threshold level for the tactile stimulation and response features of ERD/ERS-based specific indices upon changes in high-frequency vibrations,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018336282&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00207&partnerID=40&md5=689253be77cfe3b7e62b8677d62eb097,"This study was conducted to identify characteristics of the perceptual threshold level and electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to vibrotactile stimulations at various high frequencies, and to examine the possibility of distinguishing vibrotactile stimulations by frequency through such response characteristics. The vibrotactile stimulations of six frequencies (150, 200, 225, 250, 275 and 300 Hz) were exerted on the first joint of the right index finger. The perceptual threshold level was defined as the first minimum perceived intensity when the intensity stimulation was exerted step by step at each vibration frequency. EEG response characteristics were investigated by examining a single index corresponding to the peak or area of event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and seven specific indices derived by combining the single ERD/ERS indices. There was a significant difference in the perceptual threshold level across different frequencies. Specifically, the differences in vibration stimulus between 150 Hz and 200 Hz, and between 150 Hz and 225 Hz were significant. Of the EEG response characteristics, the single index of the peak or area of ERD/ERS did not show a significant difference by frequency. However, (ERS−ERD), ERD × (ERS−ERD), and ERS × (ERS−ERD) showed a significant difference between vibration stimulations at 150 Hz and 200 Hz, and between vibration stimulations at 150 Hz and 225 Hz, among the specific indices combined using the peak values of ERD/ERS. Furthermore, ERS × (ERS−ERD) showed a significant difference between 150 Hz and 225 Hz, and between 225 Hz and 275 Hz among the specific indices combined using the area of ERD/ERS. The perceptual threshold level and the specific indices of ERD/ERS suggested in the present study can be used as quantitative measurement indices to distinguish high-frequency vibration stimulation. © 2017 Choi, Kim, Kim, Gim, Kim and Chung.",0.4220532319391635

With the exception of a single experiment by Plummer, Perea, & Rayner (2014, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 40, 275–283), those studies have examined words in isolation. The current studies address two potential limitations of the Plummer et al. experiment. First, because Plummer et al. used different sentence frames for words in different conditions, the effects might be due to uncontrolled differences on the sentences. Second, the absence of a frequency effect might be attributed to comparing higher and lower frequency words within a limited range. Three eye-tracking experiments examined effects of contextual diversity and frequency on Mandarin Chinese, a logographic language, for words embedded in the normal sentences. In Experiment 1, yoked words were rotated through the same sentence frame. Experiments 2a and 2b used a design similar to Plummer et al., which allows use of a larger sample of words to compare results between experiments with a smaller and larger difference in log frequency (0.41 and 1.06, respectively). In all three experiments, first-pass and later eye movement measures were significantly shorter for targets with higher contextual diversity than for targets with lower contextual diversity, with no effects of frequency. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4857142857142857

But how does visuospatial working memory affect perceptual category learning? As there is no definite answer to this question, we conducted three experiments. In Experiment 1, the dual-task paradigm with sequential presentation was adopted to investigate the influence of visuospatial working memory on rule-based and information-integration category learning. The results showed that visuospatial working memory interferes with rule-based but not information-integration category learning. In Experiment 2, the dual-task paradigm with simultaneous presentation was used, in which the categorization task was integrated into the visuospatial working memory task. The results indicated that visuospatial working memory affects information-integration category learning but not rule-based category learning. In Experiment 3, the dual-task paradigm with simultaneous presentation was employed, in which visuospatial working memory was integrated into the category learning task. The results revealed that visuospatial working memory interferes with both rule-based and information-integration category learning. Through these three experiments, we found that, regarding the rule-based category learning, working memory load is the main mechanism by which visuospatial working memory influences the discovery of the category rules. In addition, regarding the information-integration category learning, visual resources mainly operates on the category representation. © 2017 Xing and Sun.",0.4084507042253521

The present study examined whether the presence of a mobile phone causes spatial bias toward the device during a visual search task. Participants identified a target among spatially distributed non-targets. We manipulated three factors: device presence (mobile phone or notepad), target congruency (congruent or incongruent), and attentional load (set size 8 or 24). A mobile phone (or a notepad in the control condition) was placed on the left side of the computer screen. Participants also completed a questionnaire to measure Internet usage and attachment. Participants with high scores on the questionnaire rapidly identified the target at the congruent (same side as the phone) location, but the mere presence effect did not occur in this condition. In contrast, participants with low scores on the questionnaire demonstrated the mere presence effect, but no spatial bias was observed. These results suggest that the mere presence effect can be modulated by individual differences in the degree to which a device is appealing. © 2016 Japanese Psychological Association.

We enrolled 42 undergraduate students between 18 and 27 years of age, and divided them into two groups: attachment anxiety and attachment secure. All participants were primed under two conditions, the secure priming using references to the partner, and neutral priming using neutral references. We performed repeated attachment security priming combined with a dual-task paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants' reaction times in terms of responding to the facial stimuli were also measured. Attachment security priming can facilitate an individual's processing of positive emotional faces; for instance, the presentation of the partner's name was associated with stronger activities in a wide range of brain regions and faster reaction times for positive facial expressions in the subjects. The current finding of higher activity in the left-hemisphere regions for secure priming rather than neutral priming is consistent with the prediction that attachment security priming triggers the spread of the activation of a positive emotional state. However, the difference in brain activity during processing of both, positive and negative emotional facial stimuli between the two priming conditions appeared in the attachment anxiety group alone. This study indicates that the effect of attachment secure priming on the processing of emotional facial stimuli could be mediated by chronic attachment anxiety. In addition, it highlights the association between higher-order processes of the attachment system (secure attachment schema priming) and early-stage information processing system (attention), given the increased attention toward the effects of secure base schema on the processing of emotion- and attachment-related information among the insecure population. Thus, the following study has applications in providing directions for clinical treatment of mood disorders in attachment anxiety. © 2017 Tang, Chen, Hu and Liu.",0.5476190476190477

The main objective of this study was to collect data for a better understanding of the state of psychological testing worldwide. These data could guide the actions and measures taken by ITC, EFPA, and other stakeholders. A questionnaire was administered to 20,467 professional psychologists from 29 countries. Five scales were constructed relating to: concern over incorrect test use, regulations on tests and testing, internet and computerized testing, appreciation of tests, and knowledge and training relating to test use. Equivalence across countries was evaluated using the alignment method, four scales demonstrated acceptable levels of invariance. Multilevel analysis was used to determine how scores were related to age, gender, and specialization, as well as how scores varied between countries. Although the results show a high appreciation of tests in general, the appreciation of internet and computerized testing is much lower. These scales show low variability over countries, whereas differences between countries on the other reported scales are much greater. This implies the need for some overarching improvements as well as country-specific actions. © 2017 The Author(s).

Despite this history, little is known about the value of CIL services for increasing community participation of people with disabilities. We administered the CIL Participation Service Survey to 420 CIL staff members and 107 CIL board members to examine their opinions about the relative value of different CIL services for increasing community participation of their consumers. Results indicated that both staff and board members have very high regard for the value and quality of CIL services. The Independent Living (IL) philosophy of consumer choice and control was among the most highly rated aspects of CIL service delivery for both staff and board members. Overall, staff and board member responses were very consistent in terms of the top-rated strengths and weaknesses of CIL services for increasing participation among consumers. Differences appeared to reflect the daily staff focus on specific consumer need versus board members’ view of larger community issues. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",0.47368421052631576
A representation of antimatroids by Horn rules and its application to educational systems,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85001043423&doi=10.1016%2fj.jmp.2016.09.002&partnerID=40&md5=bbc92a82d02b0e75779ef6a1df7ee982,"We study a representation of an antimatroid by Horn rules, motivated by its recent application to computer-aided educational systems. We associate any set R of Horn rules with the unique maximal antimatroid A(R) that is contained in the union-closed family K(R) naturally determined by R. We address algorithmic and Boolean function theoretic aspects on the association R↦A(R), where R is viewed as the input. We present linear time algorithms to solve the membership problem and the inference problem for A(R). We also provide efficient algorithms for generating all members and all implicates of A(R). We show that this representation is essentially equivalent to the Korte–Lovász representation of antimatroids by rooted sets. Based on the equivalence, we provide a quadratic time algorithm to construct the uniquely-determined minimal representation. These results have potential applications to computer-aided educational systems, where an antimatroid is used as a model of the space of possible knowledge states of learners, and is constructed by giving Horn queries to a human expert. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.39759036144578314
Testing the Difference Between Reliability Coefficients Alpha and Omega,2017,196,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015804377&doi=10.1177%2f0013164416658325&partnerID=40&md5=13406387da0a1403bb862dd000bd487e,"Reliable measurements are key to social science research. Multiple measures of reliability of the total score have been developed, including coefficient alpha, coefficient omega, the greatest lower bound reliability, and others. Among these, the coefficient alpha has been most widely used, and it is reported in nearly every study involving the measure of a construct through multiple items in social and behavioral research. However, it is known that coefficient alpha underestimates the true reliability unless the items are tau-equivalent, and coefficient omega is deemed as a practical alternative to coefficient alpha in estimating measurement reliability of the total score. However, many researchers noticed that the difference between alpha and omega is minor in applications. Since the observed differences in alpha and omega can be due to sampling errors, the purpose of the present study, therefore, is to propose a method to evaluate the difference of coefficient alpha ((Formula presented.)) and omega ((Formula presented.)) statistically. In particular, the current article develops a procedure to estimate the SE of ((Formula presented.)) and consequently the confidence interval (CI) for ((Formula presented.)). This procedure allows us to test whether the observed difference ((Formula presented.)) is due to sample error or (Formula presented.) is significantly greater than (Formula presented.). The developed procedure is then applied to multiple real data sets from well-known scales to empirically verify the values of ((Formula presented.)) in practice. Results showed that in most of the comparisons the differences are significantly above zero but cases also exist where the CIs contain zero. An R program for calculating (Formula presented.), and the SE of ((Formula presented.)) is also included in the present study so that the developed procedure is easily accessible to applied researchers. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",0.45422535211267606
Activation of the ventral tegmental area increased wakefulness in mice,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016129945&doi=10.1007%2fs41105-017-0094-x&partnerID=40&md5=ec30376edecbb64bcfb7b31893c75414,"The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is crucial for brain functions, such as voluntary movement and cognition; however, the role of VTA in sleep-wake regulation when directly activated or inhibited remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of activation or inhibition of VTA neurons on sleep-wake behavior using the pharmacogenetic “designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD)” approach. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to confirm the microinjection sites, and combined with electrophysiological experiments, to determine whether the VTA neurons were activated or inhibited. The hM3Dq-expressing VTA neurons were excited confirmed by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)-driven c-Fos expression and firing in patch-clamp recordings; whereas the hM4Di-expressing VTA neurons inhibited by reduction of firing. Compared with controls, the activation of VTA neurons at 9:00 (inactive period) produced a 120.1% increase in the total wakefulness amount for 5 h, whereas NREM and REM sleep were decreased by 62.5 and 92.2%, respectively. Similarly, when VTA neurons were excited at 21:00 (active period), the total wakefulness amount increased 81.5%, while NREM and REM sleep decreased 64.6 and 93.8%, respectively, for 8 h. No difference of the amount and EEG power density of the NREM sleep was observed following the arousal effects of CNO. The inhibition of VTA neurons during active or inactive periods gave rise to no change in the time spent in the wakefulness, REM, and NREM sleep compared with control. The results indicated that VTA neurons activated pharmacogentically played important roles in promoting wakefulness. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.3620689655172414

Event-related potentials altered in patients with borderline personality disorder during working memory tasks,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018291316&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00067&partnerID=40&md5=5eb4e082f3dfb9a345d77461fd0881ce,"Whereas some studies have demonstrated impaired working memory (WM) among patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), these findings have not been consistent. Furthermore, there is a lack of neurophysiological evidence about WM function in patients with BPD. The goal of this study was to examine WM function in patients with BPD by using event-related potentials (ERPs). An additional goal was to explore whether characteristics of BPD (i.e., impulsiveness and emotional instability) are associated with WM impairment. A modified version of the N-back task (0- and 2-back) was used to measure WM. ERPs were recorded in 22 BPD patients and 21 age-, handedness-, and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) while they performed the WM task. The results revealed that there were no significant group differences for behavioral variables (reaction time and accuracy rate) or for latencies and amplitudes of P1 and N1 (all p > 0.05). BPD patients had lower P3 amplitudes and longer N2 latencies than HC, independent of WM load (low load: 0-back; high load: 2-back). Impulsiveness was not correlated with N2 latency or P3 amplitude, and no correlations were found between N2 latency or P3 amplitude and affect intensity scores in any WM load (all p > 0.05). In conclusion, the lower P3 amplitudes and longer N2 latencies in BPD patients suggested that they might have some dysfunction of neural activities in sub-processing in WM, while impulsiveness and negative affect might not have a close relationship with these deficits. © 2017 Liu, Zhong, Xi, Jin, Zhu, Yao and Yi.",0.3775933609958506
Regional gray matter volume is associated with restrained eating in healthy chinese young adults: Evidence from voxel-based morphometry,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016313768&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00443&partnerID=40&md5=a9cedd6efd00db71ec24f3f296ed5fff,"Highlight: • Participants were non-clinical young adults with different restrained eating levels. • We assessed relations of restrained eating (RE) with regional gray matter volume (rGMV). • High RE scores were related to larger GMV in specific areas related to reward. • High RE scores were also linked to less GMV in regions related to response inhibition. Objective: Dieting is a popular method of weight control. However, few dieters are able to maintain initial weight losses over an extended period of time. Why do most restrained dieters fail to lose weight? Alterations in brain structures associated with restrained eating (RE) represent one potentially important mechanism that contributes to difficulties in maintaining weight loss within this group. To evaluate this contention, we investigated associations between intentional, sustained restriction of food intake to lose or maintain body weight, and regional gray matter volume (rGMV) within a large non-clinical young adult, sample. Methods: Participants (150 women, 108 men) completed measures of RE and demographics prior to undergoing an MRI scan. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) evaluated strengths of association between RE scores and rGMV. Results: Higher RE levels corresponded to more rGMV in regions linked to risk of overeating and binge-eating including the left insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Conversely, RE had significant negative correlations with rGMV in the left and right posterior cingulum gyrus, regions linked to inhibitory control and potential risk for future weight gain. Conclusions: Together, findings suggested individual differences in RE among young adults correspond to GMV variability in regions linked to overweight and obesity risk. © 2017 Su, Jackson, Wei, Qiu and Chen.",0.4823529411764706
Change of Rin1 and stathmin in the animal model of traumatic stresses,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018363314&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00062&partnerID=40&md5=4f8fc57a329542300d7b3ba1252e85fd,"The molecular mechanism of fear memory is poorly understood. Therefore, the pathogenesis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), whose symptom presentation can enhance fear memory, remains largely unclear. Recent studies with knockout animals have reported that Rin1 and stathmin regulate fear memory. Rin1 inhibits acquisition and promotes memory extinction, whereas stathmin regulates innate and basal fear. The aim of our study was to examine changes in the expression of Rin1 and stathmin in different animal models of stress, particluarly traumatic stress. We used three animal traumatic stresses: single prolonged stress (SPS, which is a rodent model of PTSD), an immobilization-stress (IM) and a Loud sound stress (LSS), to examine the change and uniqueness in Rin1/stathmin expression. Behavioral tests of SPS rats demonstrated increased anxiety and contextual fear-conditioning. They showed decreased long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as decreased stathmin and increased Rin1 expression in the hippocampus and the amygdala. Expression of the stathmin effector, tubulin, and downstream molecules Rin1, Rab5, and Abl, appeared to increase. Rin1 and EphA4 were endogenously coexpressed in primary neurons after SPS stimulation. IM rats exhibited increased anxiety behavior and enhanced fear-conditioning to contextual and auditory stimuli. Similar changes in expression of Rin1/stathmin were observed in IM rats whereas no changes were observed in rats exposed to a loud sound. These data suggest that changes in expression of the Rin1 and stathmin genes may be involved in rodents with SPS and IM stresses, which provide valuable insight into fear memories under abnormal conditions, particularly in PTSD. © 2017 Han, Jiang, Ding, Liu, Xiao and Shi.",0.43529411764705883
Automatic processing of emotional words in the absence of awareness: The critical role of P2,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018191384&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00592&partnerID=40&md5=e250c13a822a14d335c2ba00e0dda791,"It has been long debated to what extent emotional words can be processed in the absence of awareness. Behavioral studies have shown that the meaning of emotional words can be accessed even without any awareness. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed that emotional words that are unconsciously presented do not activate the brain regions involved in semantic or emotional processing. To clarify this point, we used continuous flash suppression (CFS) and event-related potential (ERP) techniques to distinguish between semantic and emotional processing. In CFS, we successively flashed some Mondrian-style images into one participant's eye steadily, which suppressed the images projected to the other eye. Negative, neutral, and scrambled words were presented to 16 healthy participants for 500 ms. Whenever the participants saw the stimuli-in both visible and invisible conditions-they pressed specific keyboard buttons. Behavioral data revealed that there was no difference in reaction time to negative words and to neutral words in the invisible condition, although negative words were processed faster than neutral words in the visible condition. The ERP results showed that negative words elicited a larger P2 amplitude in the invisible condition than in the visible condition. The P2 component was enhanced for the neutral words compared with the scrambled words in the visible condition; however, the scrambled words elicited larger P2 amplitudes than the neutral words in the invisible condition. These results suggest that the emotional processing of words is more sensitive than semantic processing in the conscious condition. Semantic processing was found to be attenuated in the absence of awareness. Our findings indicate that P2 plays an important role in the unconscious processing of emotional words, which highlights the fact that emotional processing may be automatic and prioritized compared with semantic processing in the absence of awareness. © 2017 Lei, Dou, Liu, Zhang, Zhang and Li.",0.40268456375838924

Previous studies have shown that scales provided around tactile maps for blind persons can shorten the search time for tactile symbols on the maps, but the optimum number of divisions has not been found. We conducted an experiment in which maps with different numbers of divisions were presented to blindfolded participants. The search times for tactile targets on the maps were measured and a movie that recorded searching behavior was analyzed. Our results indicate that scales with 3 × 4 divisions minimize search time, and the movie analysis reveals that this optimization is determined by the time of both scale-counting and target-searching. This finding elucidates the manner of human haptic search and should be utilized for the optimization of automated tactile map creation. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

Although still controversial, recent studies have demonstrated the role of the LOTC in higher-level body-related cognition in humans. This study consisted of two experiments (E1 and E2). The first (E1) was an exploratory experiment to find the neural correlate of the mental manipulation of body part imagery, in which brain cerebral glucose metabolic rates and the performance of mental rotation of the hand were measured in 100 subjects who exhibited a range of symptoms of cognitive decline. In E1, we found that the level of glucose metabolism in the right LOTC was significantly correlated with performance in a task involving mental manipulation of the hand. Next, in E2, we performed a randomized, double-blind, controlled intervention study (clinical trial number: UMIN 000018310) in younger healthy adults to test whether right occipital (corresponding to the right LOTC) anodal stimulation using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could enhance the mental manipulation of the hand. In E2, we demonstrated a significant effect of tDCS on the accuracy rate in a task involving mental manipulation of the hand. Although further study is necessary to answer the question of whether these results are specific for the mental manipulation of body parts but not non-body parts, E1 demonstrated a possible role of the LOTC in carrying out the body mental manipulation task in patients with dementia, and E2 suggested the possible effect of tDCS on this task in healthy subjects. © 2017 Kikuchi, Takahashi, Hirosawa, Oboshi, Yoshikawa, Minabe and Ouchi.",0.3576923076923077

In Experiment 1, we suggested a literature-based, directive approach to emotional visual music design, and inspected the emotional meanings thereof using the self-rated psychometric and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses of the viewers. A two-dimensional (2D) approach to the assessment of emotion (the valence-arousal plane) with frontal alpha power asymmetry EEG (as a proposed index of valence) validated our visual music as an emotional stimulus. In Experiment 2, we used our synthetic stimuli to investigate possible underlying mechanisms of affective evaluation mechanisms in relation to audio and visual integration conditions between modalities (namely congruent, complementation, or incongruent combinations). In this experiment, we found that, when arousal information between auditory and visual modalities was contradictory [for example, active (+) on the audio channel but passive (-) on the video channel], the perceived emotion of cross-modal perception (visual music) followed the channel conveying the stronger arousal. Moreover, we found that an enhancement effect (heightened and compacted in subjects' emotional responses) in the aesthetic perception of visual music might occur when the two channels contained contradictory arousal information and positive congruency in valence and texture/control. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a literature-based directive production of emotional visual music prototypes and the validations thereof for the study of cross-modally evoked aesthetic experiences in human subjects. © 2017 Lee, Latchoumane and Jeong.",0.4738955823293173

The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between the representations of new and prior meanings of ambiguous words in second language (L2) learning, and to explore the function of inhibitory control on L2 ambiguous word learning at the initial stage of learning. During a 4-day learning phase, Chinese-English bilinguals learned 30 novel English words for 30 min per day using bilingual flashcards. Half of the words to be learned were unambiguous (had one meaning) and half were ambiguous (had two semantically unrelated meanings learned in sequence). Inhibitory control was introduced as a subject variable measured by a Stroop task. The semantic representations established for the studied items were probed using a cross-language semantic relatedness judgment task, in which the learned English words served as the prime, and the targets were either semantically related or unrelated to the prime. Results showed that response latencies for the second meaning of ambiguous words were slower than for the first meaning and for unambiguous words, and that performance on only the second meaning of ambiguous words was predicted by inhibitory control ability. These results suggest that, at the initial stage of L2 ambiguous word learning, the representation of the second meaning is weak, probably interfered with by the representation of the prior learned meaning. Moreover, inhibitory control may modulate learning of the new meanings, such that individuals with better inhibitory control may more effectively suppress interference from the first meaning, and thus learn the new meaning more quickly. © 2017 Lu, Wu, Dunlap and Chen.",0.43346007604562736

A total of 227 primary school students aged 10-13 years were analyzed for weight and height, of which 159 children (44 ""obese,"" 23 ""overweight,"" and 92 ""normal weight"") filled out questionnaires on school performance and socioeconomic status.

The results showed there were significant academic performance differences among the three groups, with normal-weight children scoring higher than overweight and obese children after Bonferroni correction. A mediation model revealed a partial indirect effect of working memory in the relationship between obesity and academic performance. Although the performance of obese children in basic working memory tests was poorer than that of normal-weight children, they recalled more items than normal-weight children in working memory tasks involving with food/drink. Working memory deficits partially explain the poor academic performance of obese children.

Steady beat sound facilitates both coordinated group walking and inter-subject neural synchrony,2017,35,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018285958&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00147&partnerID=40&md5=47564759c3989d86d2d007b382858b87,"Group walking is a collective social interaction task as pedestrians are required to determine their own pace of walking on the basis of surrounding others’ states. The steady beat sound is known to be a controllable factor that contributes to relative success/failure of coordinated group walking since the beat improves pedestrian flow in congested situation. According to some reports, inter-personal interaction synchronizes inter-personal brain activity in the prefrontal region, which supports social cognitive processes required for successful inter-individual coordination, such as predicting each other’s state; success/failure of a coordinated task is associated with increase/decrease in inter-subject neural synchrony (INS). Combining these previous findings, we hypothesized that INS during group walking in congested situations would also differ depending on the existence of the steady beat, corresponding to the modulated coordination-related cognitive processes. Subjects’ frontopolar activities were measured using ultra-small near infrared spectroscopy, which can simultaneously measure the brain activities of multiple subjects without constraints on their motions. To exclude the possibility that increased INS may be spuriously induced by the shared stimuli (i.e., steady beat) or by the resultant behavioral synchronization, as control we used stepping on a same spot, which is similar in movement to walking but does not require the subjects to consider others’ states, either with or without the steady beat. In a two by two repeated measures factorial experimental design, the subjects were instructed to walk or keep stepping on a same spot with or without a steady beat sound of 70 beats per minute. As previously reported, the walking flow during group walking with the beat significantly increased compared with that without the beat. Synchronization of stepping between the subjects was also significantly increased by the steady beat sound. For INS, we observed a significant interaction effect between walking/stepping and sound/no-sound, supporting our hypothesis. INS while walking with the beat was higher than that without the beat, whereas the beat induced no significant differences in INS during stepping. Furthermore, the effect of the beat on INS while walking was spatially extended beyond the adjacent pedestrians, reflecting the diffuse nature of the collective coordination in group walking. The increase of INS for walking suggested that the steady beat sound led to more harmonized inter-personal cognitive processes, which resulted in the more coordinated group motion. © 2017 Ikeda, Nozawa, Yokoyama, Miyazaki, Sasaki, Sakaki and Kawashima.",0.3723958333333333

Recently, research has found converging evidence on the influence of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene on prosociality. Meanwhile, moral reasoning, a key precursor for social behavior, has also been associated with variability in OXTR gene, thus the relationship between OXTR and prosociality is assumed to be mediated by moral evaluation. The current study examines the relationship in question, and includes gender as a potential moderator. Self-reported prosociality on Prosocial Tendencies Measure and evaluation on the moral acceptability of behaviors in stories from 790 Chinese adolescents (32.4% boys) were analyzed for the influence of their OXTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results showed that SNP at site rs2254298 was indirectly associated with prosocial behaviors via moral evaluation of behaviors, and this effect was moderated by gender. Our findings suggest an indirect association between genetic variations in OXTR and prosociality through moral evaluation, indicating the potential pathway from genetic variability to prosociality through level of moral development. We also provide some evidence that the role of oxytocin system may to some extent depend on gender. These findings may promote our understanding of the genetic and biological roots of prosociality and morality. © 2017 Shang, Wu and Su.",0.3942307692307692

In Experiment 1, a lexical decision task was used where the novel words served as primes for target words in four conditions: (1) corresponding concepts of the novel words, (2) thematically related words in the same episodes as that in learning condition, (3) thematically related words in different episodes, or (4) unrelated words served as targets. Event related potentials elicited by the targets revealed that compared to the unrelated words, the corresponding concepts and thematically related words in the same episodes elicited smaller N400s with a frontal-central distribution, whereas the thematically related words in different episodes elicited an enhanced late positive component. Experiment 2 further showed a priming effect of the corresponding concepts on the thematically related words in the same episodes as well as in a different episode, indicating that the absence of a priming effect of the learned novel words on the thematically related words in different episode could not be attributed to inappropriate selection of thematically related words in the two conditions. These results indicate that only the corresponding concepts and the thematically related words in the learning episodes were successfully primed, whereas the thematic association between the novel words and the thematically related words in different scenarios could only be recognized in a late processing stage. Our findings suggest that thematic knowledge of novel words is organized via separate scenarios, which are represented in a clustered manner in the semantic network. © 2017 Zhang, Chen, Wang, Yang and Yang.",0.43656716417910446
Insights for management among non-gaming industries: Employees’ dissonance in a casino dominant economy; [Ideas para la gestión en sectores no relacionados con el juego: la disonancia de los empleados en una economía dominada por los casinos],2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013682919&doi=10.1016%2fj.rpto.2016.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=754cffc96fb3b8fe90f8e377f4383930,"This study examined 290 full-time employees among non-gaming industries at Macau, where the economy was mainly dominated by the revenue from casinos. It clarified that work satisfaction was fairly low for employees in non-gaming industries, and dissonance was generated due to the discrepancy between employees’ work satisfaction and affective commitment. Organizational variables – management ethics and distributive justice –, a socio-emotional variable – family emotional support –, as well as personality variables – conscientiousness and neuroticism – were assessed in relation to work satisfaction and affective commitment. Regressions found distributive justice to be the most powerful and positive predictor that, together with management ethics and family emotional support, were the positive predictors of both work satisfaction and affective commitment. In addition, conscientiousness was a positive predictor, while neuroticism was a negative predictor of work satisfaction. Results were interpreted in relation to management, and implications for human resource management practice in non-gaming industries were discussed. © 2017 Colegio Oficial de Psicólogos de Madrid",0.5163398692810458

Feedback-related negativity (FRN) is an electrophysiological measure reflecting the activity of this monitoring system via feedback signals, and is generated from the anterior cingulate cortex. However, there have been no reports on FRN in AD. Based on prior aging studies, we hypothesized that FRN would decrease in AD patients. To assess this, FRN was measured in healthy individuals and those with AD during a simple gambling task involving positive and negative feedback stimuli. Contrary to our hypothesis, FRN amplitude increased in AD patients, compared with the healthy elderly. We speculate that this may reflect the existence of a compensatory mechanism against the decline in executive function. Also, there was a significant association between FRN amplitude and depression scores in AD, and the FRN amplitude tended to increase insomuch as the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) was higher. This result suggests the existence of a negative bias in the affective state in AD. Thus, the impaired functioning monitoring system in AD is a more complex phenomenon than we thought. © 2017 Nitta, Onoda, Ishitobi, Okazaki, Mishima, Nagai and Yamaguchi.",0.41708542713567837

The present study aimed to identify the family and individual risk and protective factors for depression in an at-risk sample of Chinese migrant children. Participants were 368 children (9.47 ± 1.46 years old, 73.4% boys) who had at least one symptom of Oppositional Defiant Disorder symptoms (ODD) and their parents in Mainland China. Risk and protective factors within both family (i.e., family maltreatment and family functioning) and individual (i.e., automatic thoughts and resilience) perspectives. Family maltreatment and negative automatic thoughts served as risk factors in relation to children's depression. Further, automatic thoughts mediated the relationship between family maltreatment and children's depression. Family functioning (cohesion, but bot adaptability) and individual resilience could buffer the effects of risk factors in the Structure Emotion Model such that both cohesion and resilience moderated the relationship between family maltreatment and children's automatic thoughts only. Our findings highlighted the urgent need to decrease risk factors and increase protective factors of both family and child individual characteristics in prevention and intervention depression among migrant children with ODD symptoms in China. © 2017 Liu, Lin, Zhou, Zhou, Li and Lin.",0.5526315789473685
Individual differences in automatic emotion regulation interact with primed emotion regulation during an anger provocation,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018329053&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00614&partnerID=40&md5=3a62f2f01852a1b153a6a8cf00035673,"The current study investigated the interactive effects of individual differences in automatic emotion regulation (AER) and primed emotion regulation strategy on skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate during provoked anger. The study was a 2 × 2 [AER tendency (expression vs. control) × priming (expression vs. control)] between subject design. Participants were assigned to two groups according to their performance on an emotion regulation-IAT (differentiating automatic emotion control tendency and automatic emotion expression tendency). Then participants of the two groups were randomly assigned to two emotion regulation priming conditions (emotion control priming or emotion expression priming). Anger was provoked by blaming participants for slow performance during a subsequent backward subtraction task. In anger provocation, SCL of individuals with automatic emotion control tendencies in the control priming condition was lower than of those with automatic emotion control tendencies in the expression priming condition. However, SCL of individuals with automatic emotion expression tendencies did no differ in the automatic emotion control priming or the automatic emotion expression priming condition. Heart rate during anger provocation was higher in individuals with automatic emotion expression tendencies than in individuals with automatic emotion control tendencies regardless of priming condition. This pattern indicates an interactive effect of individual differences in AER and emotion regulation priming on SCL, which is an index of emotional arousal. Heart rate was only sensitive to the individual differences in AER, and did not reflect this interaction. This finding has implications for clinical studies of the use of emotion regulation strategy training suggesting that different practices are optimal for individuals who differ in AER tendencies. © 2017 Zhang, Lipp and Hu.",0.5057034220532319

Overall, 181 youngsters aged between 10 and 14 participated in the current study. Images of disgusted faces were used as threat stimuli in an Exogenous Cueing Task was used to measure the subcomponents of attentional bias. Additionally, the Social Anxiety Scale for Children was used to measure social anxiety. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that male participants with high social anxiety showed difficulty in disengaging from threat, but this was not the case for female participants. Our results indicated that social anxiety is more related with attentional bias to threat among male children and adolescents than females.

Do demographic characteristics make differences? Demographic characteristics as moderators in the associations between only child status and cognitive/non-cognitive outcomes in China,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018336019&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00423&partnerID=40&md5=f01516c9c0f8f36cf855a7e094bc9efb,"Different family compositions and sizes may affect child development through the different modes of interaction between family members. Previous studies have compared only children with non-only children in cognitive/non-cognitive outcomes. However, relatively little research has systematically investigated the potential moderators among them. Using a large and representative sample of Chinese students (Grades 7-8; N = 5,752), this study examines the roles of demographic characteristics, such as gender, region, parental educational level, parental expectations, family socio-economic status and family structure, in the associations between only child status and cognitive/non-cognitive outcomes. For the cognitive outcomes, only child status exerts an influence on the students' academic performance in Chinese and mathematics in the sample of three districts' students. The examined associations between only child status and cognitive outcomes are different in region, parental education, parental expectations and family structure, while gender and family socio-economic status did not. For the non-cognitive outcomes, only child status exerts an influence on the students' school well-being, academic self-efficacy, academic self-concept, and internal academic motivation in the full sample of students, but not on external academic motivation. Further, the examined associations between only child status and non-cognitive outcomes are different in region, parental education, family socio-economic status and family structure, while gender and parental expectations did not. These findings suggest that the associations between only child status and cognitive/non-cognitive outcomes are heterogeneous in terms of some of the demographic characteristics. Possible explanations are proposed in some concepts of region and family environment in China. © 2017 Liu, Chen, Yang and Hu.",0.532258064516129
Researchers’ choice of the number and range of levels in experiments affects the resultant variance-accounted-for effect size,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981294478&doi=10.3758%2fs13423-016-1128-0&partnerID=40&md5=6e7774ab807fc691e8c19f922af9a617,"In psychology, the reporting of variance-accounted-for effect size indices has been recommended and widely accepted through the movement away from null hypothesis significance testing. However, most researchers have paid insufficient attention to the fact that effect sizes depend on the choice of the number of levels and their ranges in experiments. Moreover, the functional form of how and how much this choice affects the resultant effect size has not thus far been studied. We show that the relationship between the population effect size and number and range of levels is given as an explicit function under reasonable assumptions. Counterintuitively, it is found that researchers may affect the resultant effect size to be either double or half simply by suitably choosing the number of levels and their ranges. Through a simulation study, we confirm that this relation also applies to sample effect size indices in much the same way. Therefore, the variance-accounted-for effect size would be substantially affected by the basic research design such as the number of levels. Simple cross-study comparisons and a meta-analysis of variance-accounted-for effect sizes would generally be irrational unless differences in research designs are explicitly considered. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.46113989637305697
Presence and absence of muscle contraction elicited by peripheral nerve electrical stimulation differentially modulate primary motor cortex excitability,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018280416&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00146&partnerID=40&md5=286bbf83716c0ee484d16d81759f354c,"Modulation of cortical excitability by sensory inputs is a critical component of sensorimotor integration. Sensory afferents, including muscle and joint afferents, to somatosensory cortex (S1) modulate primary motor cortex (M1) excitability, but the effects of muscle and joint afferents specifically activated by muscle contraction are unknown. We compared motor evoked potentials (MEPs) following median nerve stimulation (MNS) above and below the contraction threshold based on the persistence of M-waves. Peripheral nerve electrical stimulation (PES) conditions, including right MNS at the wrist at 110% motor threshold (MT; 110% MNS condition), right MNS at the index finger (sensory digit nerve stimulation [DNS]) with stimulus intensity approximately 110% MNS (DNS condition), and right MNS at the wrist at 90% MT (90% MNS condition) were applied. PES was administered in a 4 s ON and 6 s OFF cycle for 20 min at 30 Hz. In Experiment 1 (n = 15), MEPs were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) before (baseline) and after PES. In Experiment 2 (n = 15), M- and F-waves were recorded from the right APB. Stimulation at 110% MNS at the wrist evoking muscle contraction increased MEP amplitudes after PES compared with those at baseline, whereas DNS at the index finger and 90% MNS at the wrist not evoking muscle contraction decreased MEP amplitudes after PES. M- and F-waves, which reflect spinal cord or muscular and neuromuscular junctions, did not change following PES. These results suggest that muscle contraction and concomitant muscle/joint afferent inputs specifically enhance M1 excitability. © 2017 Sasaki, Kotan, Nakagawa, Miyaguchi, Kojima, Saito, Inukai and Onishi.",0.4628099173553719

Perturbing balance tests are often used in healthy subjects to imitate either pathological conditions or to test the sensitivity of postural analysis techniques. Eleven healthy adult subjects were asked to stand in normal stance in three experimental conditions while the visuo-kinesthetic input was altered. COP displacement was recorded using a force plate. Three entropy measures [Sample Entropy (SE), Multi-Scale Entropy (MSE), and Multivariate Multi Scale Entropy (MMSE)] describing COP regularity at different scales were compared to traditional measures of COP variability. The analyses of the COP trajectories revealed that suppression of vision produced minor changes in COP displacement and in the COP characteristics. The comparison with the reference analysis showed that the entropy measures analysis techniques are more sensitive in the incremented time series compared to the classical parameters and entropy measures of original time series. Non-linear methods appear to be an additional valuable tool for analysis of the dynamics of posture especially when applied on incremental time series. © 2017 Hansen, Wei, Shieh, Fourcade, Isableu and Majed.",0.5187165775401069
The involvement of central attention in visual search is determined by task demands,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010739412&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-017-1278-9&partnerID=40&md5=427526bf69bdfbc63351919dacfd319d,"Attention, the mechanism by which a subset of sensory inputs is prioritized over others, operates at multiple processing stages. Specifically, attention enhances weak sensory signal at the perceptual stage, while it serves to select appropriate responses or consolidate sensory representations into short-term memory at the central stage. This study investigated the independence and interaction between perceptual and central attention. To do so, I used a dual-task paradigm, pairing a four-alternative choice task with a visual search task. The results showed that central attention for response selection was engaged in perceptual processing for visual search when the number of search items increased, thereby increasing the demand for serial allocation of focal attention. By contrast, central attention and perceptual attention remained independent as far as the demand for serial shifting of focal attention remained constant; decreasing stimulus contrast or increasing the set size of a parallel search did not evoke the involvement of central attention in visual search. These results suggest that the nature of concurrent visual search process plays a crucial role in the functional interaction between two different types of attention. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4972972972972973

However the reliability of TMS-derived CSE measures is suboptimal due to appreciable pulse-to-pulse MEP amplitude variability. We thus calculated how many TMS–derived MEPs will be needed to obtain a reliable CSE measure in awake adult subjects, in the eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions. Methods: Twenty healthy adults (70% male) received 40 consecutive navigated TMS pulses (120% resting motor threshold, RMT) in the EO or EC conditions on two separate days in randomized order. Results: For either the EO or EC condition, the probability that the 95% confidence interval (CI) derived from consecutive MEP amplitude measured included the true CSE, increased when the number of consecutive stimuli increased (EO: p = 0.05; EC: p = 0.001). No significant effect of RMT, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, or gender on the CSE estimates was identified. At least 34 consecutive stimuli were required to obtain a most reliable CSE estimate in the EO condition and 31 in the EC condition.

Response readiness modulates the development of association-based automaticity in masked priming,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009241604&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-016-1275-4&partnerID=40&md5=abf937f7e0464f9e2d4509ec95b7436e,"The current study investigated the role of the automatization of stimulus and response (S-R) associations and response readiness in triggering the motor activation for masked primes in two experiments. The automatization of associations was manipulated by employing different types of stimuli, and response readiness was manipulated by varying the relative frequency of Go trials in a modified Go/No-Go task. Compatibility (compatible and incompatible), stimulus type (arrows and parallel lines), and test session (Sessions 1, 2, and 3) were manipulated in a high response-readiness condition (Experiment 1) and in a low response-readiness condition (Experiment 2). Negative compatibility effects (NCEs) occurred regardless of session and experiment in the arrow stimuli condition. However, in the parallel-line stimuli condition, no significant compatibility effect (CE) appeared regardless of the experiment in Sessions 1 and 2, whereas a significant NCE appeared in Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2 in Session 3. These results are consistent with the claim that motor activation can only occur if the association between specific stimuli and specific responses has been automatized by previous practice, and response readiness can modulate the development of automaticity, but this modulation will have a minimal effect once the association is automatized. The findings also provide experimental evidence for the assumption that the formation of association-based automaticity could be modulated by top-down control (e.g., response readiness). © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4392523364485981

In total, 21 patients with SCI (10 with complete and 11 with incomplete SCI) and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The 3D high-resolution T1-weighted structural images of all subjects were obtained using a 3.0 Tesla MRI system. Disease duration and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Scale scores were also obtained from each patient. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was carried out to investigate the differences in GMV between patients with SCI and HCs, and between the SCI sub-groups. Associations between GMV and clinical variables were also analyzed. Compared with HCs, patients with SCI showed significant GMV decrease in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral anterior insular cortex, bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and right superior temporal gyrus. No significant difference in GMV in these areas was found either between the complete and incomplete SCI sub-groups, or between the sub-acute (duration <1 year) and chronic (duration >1 year) sub-groups. Finally, the GMV of the right OFC was correlated with the clinical motor scores of left extremities in not only all SCI patients, but especially the CSCI subgroup. In the sub-acute subgroup, we found a significant positive correlation between the dACC GMV and the total clinical motor scores, and a significant negative correlation between right OFCGMV and the injury duration. These findings indicate that SCI can cause remote atrophy of brain gray matter, especially in the salient network. In general, the duration and severity of SCI may be not associated with the degree of brain atrophy in total SCI patients, but there may be associations between them in subgroups. © 2017 Chen, Zheng, Chen, Wan, Qin, Qi, Chen and Li.",0.43333333333333335

However, much remains to be learned about posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after this experience. The WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey initiative provides a unique opportunity to address these issues. Methods: Data from 19 WMH surveys (n = 78,023; 70.1% weighted response rate) were collated. Potential predictors of PTSD (respondent sociodemographics, characteristics of the death, history of prior trauma exposure, history of prior mental disorders) after a representative sample of UDs were examined using logistic regression. Simulation was used to estimate overall model strength in targeting individuals at highest PTSD risk. Results: PTSD prevalence after UD averaged 5.2% across surveys and did not differ significantly between high-income and low-middle income countries. Significant multivariate predictors included the deceased being a spouse or child, the respondent being female and believing they could have done something to prevent the death, prior trauma exposure, and history of prior mental disorders. The final model was strongly predictive of PTSD, with the 5% of respondents having highest estimated risk including 30.6% of all cases of PTSD. Positive predictive value (i.e., the proportion of high-risk individuals who actually developed PTSD) among the 5% of respondents with highest predicted risk was 25.3%. Conclusions: The high prevalence and meaningful risk of PTSD make UD a major public health issue. This study provides novel insights into predictors of PTSD after this experience and suggests that screening assessments might be useful in identifying high-risk individuals for preventive interventions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.42971887550200805

Here we tested the following working hypotheses: compared to nonathletes, athletes showed lower cortical activation in task-sensitive brain areas during the processing of sports related and sports unrelated visuo-spatial tasks. To address this issue, cortical activation was examined with fMRI in 14 table tennis athletes and 14 non-athletes while performing the visuo-spatial tasks. Behavioral results showed that athletes reacted faster than non-athletes during both types of the tasks, and no accuracy difference was found between athletes and non-athletes. fMRI data showed that, athletes exhibited less brain activation than non-athletes in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right middle orbitofrontal area, right supplementary motor area, right paracentral lobule, right precuneus, left supramarginal gyrus, right angular gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, bilateral lingual gyrus and left cerebellum crus. No region was significantly more activated in the athletes than in the non-athletes. These findings possibly suggest that long-standing training prompt athletes develop a focused and efficient organization of task-related neural networks, as a possible index of “neural efficiency” in athletes engaged in visuo-spatial tasks, and this functional reorganization is possibly task-specific. © 2017 Guo, Li and Yu.",0.37799043062200954

The current study empirically examined the central tenets of the CPM, which posit that nonreactivity moderates the indirect effect of observation on symptoms of emotional disorders through cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Methods A clinical sample (n=1667) of individuals from Japan completed a battery of self-report instruments. Several path analyses were conducted to determine whether cognitive emotion regulation strategies mediate the relationship between observation and symptoms of individual emotional disorders, and to determine whether nonreactivity moderated these indirect effects. Results Results provided support the CPM. Specifically, nonreactivity moderated the indirect effect of observation on symptoms through reappraisal, but it did not moderate the indirect effect of observation on symptoms through suppression. Limitations Causal interpretations are limited, and cultural considerations must be acknowledged given the Japanese sample Conclusions These results underscore the potential importance of nonreactivity and emotion regulation as targets for interventions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.41916167664670656

Family processes were examined separately for maternal and paternal variables. Method: This study used survey data from Korean American families living in the Midwest (256 youth and their parents) across 2 time periods, spanned over a year. At the time of the first interview, the average age of youth was 13 (SD = 1.00). Using structural equation modeling, this study tested the hypothesized associations concurrently, longitudinally, and accounting for earlier outcomes. Results and Conclusion: Results show that identity and behavioral enculturation in one's heritage culture are predictors of bonding with parents, which is notably protective for youth. The results highlight the critical effect of enculturation in enhancing youth perception of the parent- child relationship. Behavioral acculturation to mainstream culture, in contrast, predicts youth problems, although the effect may not necessarily always be via family processes.

Character decomposition and transposition processes of Chinese compound words in rapid serial visual presentation,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016639040&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00483&partnerID=40&md5=e64252fc3bb543761b0816c7554490fe,"Character order information is encoded at the initial stage of Chinese word processing, however, its time course remains underspecified. In this study, we assess the exact time course of the character decomposition and transposition processes of two-character Chinese compound words (canonical, transposed, or reversible words) compared with pseudowords using dual-target rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of stimuli appearing at 30 ms per character with no inter-stimulus interval. The results indicate that Chinese readers can identify words with character transpositions in rapid succession; however, a transposition cost is involved in identifying transposed words compared to canonical words. In RSVP reading, character order of words is more likely to be reversed during the period from 30 to 180 ms for canonical and reversible words, but the period from 30 to 240 ms for transposed words. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that the holistic representation of the base word is activated, however, the order of the two constituent characters is not strictly processed during the very early stage of visual word processing. © 2017 Cao, Yang and Yan.",0.4642857142857143
Exploring tactile perceptual dimensions using materials associated with sensory vocabulary,2017,22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018350554&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00569&partnerID=40&md5=98d68f63451741addaa21a5adf3979ba,"Considering tactile sensation when designing products is important because the decision to purchase often depends on how products feel. Numerous psychophysical studies have attempted to identify important factors that describe tactile perceptions. However, the numbers and types of major tactile dimensions reported in previous studies have varied because of differences in materials used across experiments. To obtain a more complete picture of perceptual space with regard to touch, our study focuses on using vocabulary that expresses tactile sensations as a guiding principle for collecting material samples because these types of words are expected to cover all the basic categories within tactile perceptual space. We collected 120 materials based on a variety of Japanese sound-symbolic words for tactile sensations, and used the materials to examine tactile perceptual dimensions and their associations with affective evaluations. Analysis revealed six major dimensions: ""Affective evaluation and Friction,"" ""Compliance,"" ""Surface,"" ""Volume,"" ""Temperature,"" and ""Naturalness."" These dimensions include four factors that previous studies have regarded as fundamental, as well as two new factors: ""Volume"" and ""Naturalness."" Additionally, we showed that ""Affective evaluation"" is more closely related to the ""Friction"" component (slipperiness and dryness) than to other tactile perceptual features. Our study demonstrates that using vocabulary could be an effective method for selecting material samples to explore tactile perceptual space. © 2017 Sakamoto and Watanabe.",0.6074766355140186

Task performance modulates functional connectivity involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014014069&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00056&partnerID=40&md5=97ff07ff6277f7c294842c5eaca3f5d1,"Previous studies have suggested that patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls exhibit differential activation of and connectivity involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during working memory tasks, though their findings remain inconsistent. The functional integration perspective further suggests that working memory performance also modulates differences in functional interactions of the DLPFC between patients and controls. To explore this possibility, 45 healthy controls and 45 patients with schizophrenia were recruited to perform a 2-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each group was further divided into two subgroups based on task performance to examine the modulatory effect of performance on functional interactions of the DLPFC, as measured via psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. We observed that, in patients with schizophrenia who exhibited impaired working memory capacity and decreased brain activation/deactivation, functional interactions between the right/left DLPFC and angular cortex were decreased relative to those of healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect of working memory performance and diagnosis on functional connectivity between the right/left DLPFC seed region and posterior regions such as the angular cortex, fusiform gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. This interaction effect was mainly driven by the negative correlation between functional connectivity and performance in healthy controls, and by the positive correlation in patients with schizophrenia. These results demonstrate the effects of inter-individual differences in working memory performance on functional interactions between the DLPFC and posterior regions in patients with schizophrenia as well as healthy controls, which may shed new light on the neural basis of working memory. © 2017 Wu, Wang, Chen, Zou, Huang, Li, Zhao, Xu, Zhang, Wang, Pandit, Dahal, Chen, Zhou, Jiang and Wang.",0.4226415094339623

Motor learning abilities are similar in hemiplegic cerebral palsy compared to controls as assessed by adaptation to unilateral leg-weighting during gait: Part I,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014030306&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00049&partnerID=40&md5=67eec89b4b80bbc5951ad387abbe80d9,"Introduction: Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate high response variability to motor training insufficiently accounted for by age or severity. We propose here that differences in the inherent ability to learn new motor tasks may explain some of this variability. Damage to motor pathways involving the cerebellum, which may be a direct or indirect effect of the brain injury for many with CP, has been shown to adversely affect the ability to learn new motor tasks and may be a potential explanation. Classic adaptation paradigms that evaluate cerebellar integrity have been utilized to assess adaptation to gait perturbations in adults with stroke, traumatic brain injury and other neurological injuries but not in children with CP. Materials and Methods: A case-control study of 10 participants with and 10 without hemiplegic CP within the age range of 5–20 years was conducted. Mean age of participants in the CP group was slightly but not significantly higher than controls. Step length and swing time adaptation, defined as gradual accommodation to a perturbation, and aftereffects, or maintenance of the accommodation upon removal of the perturbation, to unilateral leg weighing during treadmill gait were quantified to assess group differences in learning. Results: Adaptation and aftereffects were demonstrated in step length across groups with no main effect for group. In CP, the dominant leg had a greater response when either leg was weighted. Swing time accommodated immediately (no adaptation) in the weighted leg only, with the non-dominant leg instead showing a more pronounced response in CP. Discussion: This group of participants with unilateral CP did not demonstrate poorer learning or retention similar to reported results in adult stroke. Deficits, while not found here, may become evident in those with other etiologies or greater severity of CP. Our data further corroborate an observation from the stroke literature that repeated practice of exaggerating the asymmetry (error augmentation), in this case by weighting the more involved or shorter step leg, vs. minimizing it by weighting the less involved or longer step leg (error reduction) may be a useful training strategy to improve step symmetry in unilateral CP. © 2017 Damiano, Stanley, Bulea and Park.",0.4326647564469914

However, depending on the type of cognitive reappraisal used, efforts to regulate emotions are sometimes met with success and other times with failure. It has been suggested the well-known age-related decline in cognitive control might be the culprit behind the poor use of detached reappraisal by older adults. However, this possibility has not been thoroughly investigated. In addition, studies have not examined what aspects of cognitive control– shifting, updating or inhibition–might be relevant to cognitive reappraisal. In the present study, 41 older participants were tested on cognitive control and abilities to use detached and positive reappraisal. Results showed detached reappraisal compared to positive relied more heavily on cognitive control, specifically mental set shifting.

Revisiting the relationship between job demands and job performance: The effects of job security and traditionality,2017,44,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84990209029&doi=10.1111%2fjoop.12158&partnerID=40&md5=0700f6d3651765cdad4964e0f24865a1,"The findings on the relationship between job demands and job performance have been inconsistent in previous studies. Drawing on social exchange theory, we examined the moderating effect of job security on the job demands–job performance relationship. Three studies with cross-sectional and time-lagged designs were conducted. The results of Studies 1 and 2 consistently demonstrated that job demands significantly improved employee performance in the context of higher job security, whereas job demands impaired performance to some extent when job security was lower. Study 3 replicated these findings and also showed that the positive moderating effect was stronger for employees with lower rather than higher levels of traditionality. The importance of job security to improving employees’ performance in stressful workplaces was affirmed. These findings contribute to theories linking job demands to job performance and have practical implications for managers in high-stress environments, especially in developing countries. Practitioner points: Job demands may lead to good performance when employees’ job security is high. Appropriate human resource practices should promise employees’ perceived job security rather than only reducing job demands. Employers should pay more attention to maintaining the social exchange relationships with employees having lower traditional values. © 2016 The British Psychological Society",0.5595854922279793
Multilevel models for intensive longitudinal data with heterogeneous autoregressive errors: The effect of misspecification and correction with Cholesky transformation,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014057589&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00262&partnerID=40&md5=991d3a5c8be19585b601ce273153f3b6,"Intensive longitudinal studies, such as ecological momentary assessment studies using electronic diaries, are gaining popularity across many areas of psychology. Multilevel models (MLMs) are most widely used analytical tools for intensive longitudinal data (ILD). Although ILD often have individually distinct patterns of serial correlation of measures over time, inferences of the fixed effects, and random components in MLMs are made under the assumption that all variance and autocovariance components are homogenous across individuals. In the present study, we introduced a multilevel model with Cholesky transformation to model ILD with individually heterogeneous covariance structure. In addition, the performance of the transformation method and the effects of misspecification of heterogeneous covariance structure were investigated through a Monte Carlo simulation. We found that, if individually heterogeneous covariances are incorrectly assumed as homogenous independent or homogenous autoregressive, MLMs produce highly biased estimates of the variance of random intercepts and the standard errors of the fixed intercept and the fixed effect of a level 2 covariate when the average autocorrelation is high. For intensive longitudinal data with individual specific residual covariance, the suggested transformation method showed lower bias in those estimates than the misspecified models when the number of repeated observations within individuals is 50 or more. © 2017 Jahng and Wood.",0.4876847290640394

Previous research has found that perceived teacher enthusiasm might contribute to reducing students' class-related boredom. However, the mechanism through which perceived teacher enthusiasm affects class-related boredom remains unexplored. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mediating role of perceived autonomy support and task value in the relationship between teacher enthusiasm and class-related boredom. College students (N = 734) completed questionnaires on perceived teacher enthusiasm, boredom proneness, perceived task difficulty, perceived autonomy support, perceived task value, and class-related boredom. Results showed that after controlling for the effects of demographic variables, boredom proneness, and perceived task difficulty, both perceived autonomy support and task value fully mediated the relationship between perceived teacher enthusiasm and class-related boredom. These findings suggest that students who perceive more teacher enthusiasm might perceive more autonomy support and task value, which in turn reduce the students' class-related boredom.

Participants were given text passages, and were first asked to predict the percentage of errors they would detect in the passage. They then read the passage and circled errors (which varied in complexity and locality), and made postdictions regarding their performance, before repeating this with another passage and answering a comprehension test of both passages. There were no age-related differences in error detection accuracy, text comprehension, or metacognitive calibration, though participants in both age groups were overconfident overall in their metacognitive judgments. Both groups gave similar ratings of motivation to complete the task. The older adults rated the passages as more interesting than younger adults did, although this level of interest did not appear to influence error-detection performance. The age equivalence in both proofreading ability and calibration suggests that the ability to proofread text passages and the associated metacognitive monitoring used in judging one’s own performance are maintained in aging. These age-related similarities persisted when younger adults completed the proofreading tasks on a computer screen, rather than with paper and pencil. The findings provide novel insights regarding the influence that cognitive aging may have on metacognitive accuracy and text processing in an everyday task. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.47478991596638653

The teachers expected the following fundamental elements from the integration: heightened criteria for teacher certifications; better work conditions for teachers; age-specific standardised curricula; and improvements to the quality of facilities because of consolidated administration and management. However, the teachers were concerned with possible challenges in the childcare field after integration and its impact on childcare teachers’ job opportunities. The teachers’ perspectives voiced in this study offer timely data that may facilitate the development of specific guidelines and directives for the integration of care and education. Implications from this study may also contribute valuable information to other countries experiencing similar challenges in combining early education and care.n. © 2017.

Causal context presented in subsequent event modifies the perceived timing of cause and effect,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017028079&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00314&partnerID=40&md5=07a6b4ae75b183cd9da7cfa316ef31e2,"The effect of perceived causality on other aspects of perception, such as temporal or spatial perception, has interested many researchers. Previous studies have shown that the perceived timing of two events is modulated when the events are intentionally produced or the causal link between the two events was known in advance. However, little research has directly supported the idea that causality alone can modulate the perceived timing of two events without having knowledge about causal links in advance. In this study, I used novel causal displays in which various types of causal contexts could be presented in subsequent events (movement or color change of objects). In these displays, the preceding events were the same (ball falling from above), so observers could not predict which subsequent events displayed. The results showed that the perceived causal context modulated the temporal relationship of two serial events so as to be consistent with the causal order implied by the subsequent event; ball hit the floor, then objects moved. These modulations were smaller when the movements implied preceding effect of the falling ball (e.g., wind pressure). These results are well-suited to the Bayesian framework in which the perceived timing of events is reconstructed through the observers' prior experiences, and suggest that multiple prior experiences would competitively contribute to the estimation of the timing of events. © 2017 Umemura.",0.4796380090497738

Olfactory reference syndrome is a preoccupation with the false belief that one emits a foul and offensive body odor. Generally, patients with olfactory reference syndrome are concerned with multiple body parts. However, the mouth is known to be the most common source of body odor for those with olfactory reference syndrome, which could imply that the two conditions share similar features. Therefore, we investigated potential causal relationships among pathologic subjective halitosis, olfactory reference syndrome, social anxiety, and preoccupations with body part odors. Methods: A total of 1360 female students (mean age 19.6 ± 1.1 years) answered a self-administered questionnaire regarding pathologic subjective halitosis, olfactory reference syndrome, social anxiety, and preoccupation with odors of body parts such as mouth, body, armpits, and feet. The scale for pathologic subjective halitosis followed that developed by Tsunoda et al.; participants were divided into three groups based on their scores (i.e., levels of pathologic subjective halitosis). A Bayesian network was used to analyze causal relationships between pathologic subjective halitosis, olfactory reference syndrome, social anxiety, and preoccupations with body part odors. Results: We found statistically significant differences in the results for olfactory reference syndrome and social anxiety among the various levels of pathologic subjective halitosis (P < 0.001). Residual analyses indicated that students with severe levels of pathologic subjective halitosis showed greater preoccupations with mouth and body odors (P < 0.05). Bayesian network analysis showed that social anxiety directly influenced pathologic subjective halitosis and olfactory reference syndrome. Preoccupations with mouth and body odors also influenced pathologic subjective halitosis. Conclusions: Social anxiety may be a causal factor of pathologic subjective halitosis and olfactory reference syndrome. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.46258503401360546

However, limited data are available regarding the association between the utilization of HTC services and condom use among low-paid female sex workers (FSWs) who are at high risk of HIV infection but are hard to reach. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 794 low-paid FSWs in a city of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 2011. Results showed that 71.7% of low-paid FSWs had utilized HTC services in the previous year and 65.7% reported having used a condom during the last sexual intercourse with their clients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that utilizing HTC services was significantly and positively associated with the condom use. It also indicated that low-paid FSWs who were older, married, had higher education, earned less money, had high number of clients, had a history of sexually transmitted diseases, or had little or no HIV knowledge were less likely to use a condom during the last sexual encounter. The study suggests that HTC services need to be scaled up and made more accessible for this vulnerable population. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.39267015706806285

However, the mechanism underlying this link has not been elucidated in terms of how chronic pain causes significant mood changes and further develops into severe anxiety or depression. The serotonergic system in the raphe nuclei is an important component in both pain processing and the pathogenesis of depression. Since the lateral habenular nucleus (LHb) controls the raphe nuclei, it may participate in the regulation of pain-associated depression. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the role of the LHb in this pathophysiological process. We used chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rats as a model for neuropathic pain and assessed the changes potentially related to the mood disorders. The forced swim test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT) were performed to determine the behavioral changes 28 days after pain surgery. Expression of β calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (βCaMKII) in the LHb, cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) activity in the LHb and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and serotonin (5-HT) levels in the DRN were measured. We found an increasing in LHb activity and βCaMKII expression, and a decrease in neuronal activity in the DRN and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5-HT ratios in the CCI rats. These effects were accompanied by the depression-like behaviors. Lesions in the LHb improved the pain threshold and depression-like behavior in the rats. These results suggest that the LHb may play a role in pain-associated depression by affecting the activity of 5-HT neurons in the DRN. Furthermore, we showed that increases in the LHb-DRN pathway activity were a common neurobiological mechanisms for pain and depression, which may explain the coexistence of pain and depression. © 2017 Li, Wang, Xuan, Li, Piao, Li and Zhao.",0.3515358361774744

We aimed to test the roles of social preference in behavioral distributive justice. We thus provide evidence of a causal link between the neural and behavioral results through the application of bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) of our participants. The participants were found to make fairer distributions within the known position after receiving right anodal/left cathodal tDCS and receiving right cathodal/left anodal tDCS over the TPJ than the participants who received the sham stimulation. Simultaneously, we elicited the participants' advantage inequity aversion and found that the participants who received right anodal/left cathodal tDCS and who received right cathodal/left anodal tDCS over the TPJ were more averse to advantage inequity. Additionally, the participants' distributive proportions to the lowest income stratum within the known position were strongly related to their social preference of advantage inequity aversion. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that the modulation of the excitability of the TPJ using tDCS altered the distributive decisions of the participants within the known position, and this effect might be attributable to a change in the individuals' social preferences. © 2017 Luo, Chen, Huang, Ye and Zheng.",0.4405940594059406

However, it was deemed important to assess ""clinically meaningful improvements, focusing on the patient's chief complaint and the severity of major IBS symptoms"" in addition to global assessment to show how ramosetron is effective for individual IBS symptoms. This is a pilot study to explore clinical endpoints focusing on the chief complaint of patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). Methods: The same database was used in a previously reported post-marketing phase IV, randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial in male patients with IBS-D.

The greatest symptomatic improvement in the chief complaint in the ramosetron 5 μg group compared to the placebo group was shown with respect to stool consistency. Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) scores were significantly lower in the ramosetron group than in the placebo group (4.36 ± 1.195 vs 4.85 ± 0.890 at the last point, P = 0.027) throughout the treatment period, except at week 6. Conclusions: Ramosetron acted most effectively on stool consistency. Improvement in stool consistency is considered to be a clinically meaningful endpoint in showing how ramosetron was effective for individual IBS symptoms. (Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT00918411.

Do you always choose what you like? Subtle social cues increase preference-choice consistency among japanese but not among americans,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014019528&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00169&partnerID=40&md5=43b52ce5f0a7c71da2329c6769862809,"Previous research has suggested that stability of self-concept differs across cultures: in North American cultural contexts, people's self-concept is stable across social contexts, whereas in Japan, different self-concepts are activated within specific social contexts. We examined the implications of this cultural difference for preference-choice consistency, which is people's tendency to make choices that are consistent with their preferences. We found that Japanese were less likely than Americans to choose items that they liked the most, showing preference-choice inconsistency. We also investigated the conditions in which Japanese might exhibit greater preference-choice consistency. Consistent with research showing that in Japanese culture, the self is primarily conceptualized and activated by social contexts, we found that subtle social cues (e.g., schematic representations of human faces) increased preference-choice consistency among Japanese, but not among Americans. These findings highlight that choices do not reveal preferences to the same extent in all cultures, and that the extent to which choices reveal preferences depends on the social context. © 2017 Uchida, Savani, Hitokoto and Kaino.",0.3939393939393939
Incentive Pay and Firm Performance: Moderating Roles of Procedural Justice Climate and Environmental Turbulence,2017,33,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947551967&doi=10.1002%2fhrm.21765&partnerID=40&md5=8cd73fe053cb804b1934ae59f219740b,"In connection with the literature on strategic reward and agency theory, this study investigates the effects of incentive pay on employee outcomes and firm performance. We identify employee outcomes, such as commitment and competence, as mediating processes that explain the effects of incentive pay on firm performance. We further propose procedural justice climate and environmental turbulence as boundary conditions that determine the strength of the effects of incentive pay on employee outcomes. The research model is tested using multisource data collected at three time points over a five-year period from 227 Korean companies. Our analysis confirmed that incentive pay enhanced employee commitment and competence, which, in turn, improved the operational and financial performances of firms. The effect of incentive pay on employee commitment was negative for firms with a low procedural justice climate, but positive for firms operated under a highly turbulent environment. By contrast, the effect of incentive pay on employee competence was positive only for firms operated under a stable environment. This study enriches the literature by presenting and validating plausible underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions under which strategic performance–contingent incentive pay affects firm performance. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.578125
The interaction between central and peripheral processing in Chinese handwritten production: Evidence from the effect of lexicality and radical complexity,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016253176&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00334&partnerID=40&md5=5e53bb48f5b92e3e1220627a12715dc8,"The interaction between central and peripheral processing in written word production remains controversial. This study aims to investigate whether the effects of radical complexity and lexicality in central processing cascade into peripheral processing in Chinese written word production. The participants were asked to write characters and non-characters (lexicality) with different radical complexity (few- and many-strokes). The findings indicated that regardless of the lexicality, the writing latencies were longer for characters with higher complexity (the many-strokes condition) than for characters with lower complexity (the few-strokes condition). The participants slowed down their writing execution at the radicals' boundary strokes, which indicated a radical boundary effect in peripheral processing. Interestingly, the lexicality and the radical complexity affected the pattern of shift velocity and writing velocity during the execution of writing. Lexical processing cascades into peripheral processing but only at the beginning of Chinese characters. In contrast, the radical complexity influenced the execution of handwriting movement throughout the entire character, and the pattern of the effect interacted with the character frequency. These results suggest that the processes of the lexicality and the radical complexity function during the execution of handwritten word production, which suggests that central processing cascades over peripheral processing during Chinese characters handwriting. © 2017 Zhang and Feng.",0.47549019607843135
Graphemes sharing phonetic features tend to induce similar synesthetic colors,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016327841&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00337&partnerID=40&md5=760569e9ae0b1d723f3c9cb49d24418d,"Individuals with grapheme-color synesthesia experience idiosyncratic colors when viewing achromatic letters or digits. Despite large individual differences in grapheme-color association, synesthetes tend to associate graphemes sharing a perceptual feature with similar synesthetic colors. Sound has been suggested as one such feature. In the present study, we investigated whether graphemes of which representative phonemes have similar phonetic features tend to be associated with analogous synesthetic colors. We tested five Korean multilingual synesthetes on a color-matching task using graphemes from Korean, English, and Japanese orthography. We then compared the similarity of synesthetic colors induced by those characters sharing a phonetic feature. Results showed that graphemes associated with the same phonetic feature tend to induce synesthetic color in both within- and cross-script analyses. Moreover, this tendency was consistent for graphemes that are not transliterable into each other as well as graphemes that are. These results suggest that it is the perceptual-i.e., phonetic-properties associated with graphemes, not just conceptual associations such as transliteration, that determine synesthetic color. © 2017 Kang, Kim, Shin and Kim.",0.3630952380952381
Difference between leisure and work contexts: The roles of perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness in predicting mobile video calling use acceptance,2017,35,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018655500&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00350&partnerID=40&md5=d946e022daa360b34668d33a152ba4a1,"There is a rapidly growing body of literature on mobile video calling, which is a promising communication technology; however, little research has focused on user acceptance of mobile video calling, especially in different use contexts. This study explored factors (especially perceived enjoyment) influencing the intention of users to employ video calling in different contexts (a work and a leisure context) by applying the technology acceptance model (TAM) combined with the theory of planned behavior. The revised research model differentiated external factors (subjective norms and personal innovativeness) from internal factors (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived enjoyment, and intention to use mobile video calling). In addition, the current study investigated predictors of perceived enjoyment across these two contexts. With the use of a structured questionnaire, participants were divided in two groups and completed self-report measures related to one context; a total of 386 student respondents' responses were analyzed. The results indicated that users' intentions were directly predicted by their perceived enjoyment of video calling (β ≥ 0.35) and the call's perceived usefulness (β ≥ 0.27) and PEU (β = 0.13, only for the leisure context), which jointly explained at least 55.6% of the variance in use intention. In addition to the effects of these predictors on mobile video calling use acceptance, an assessment of the moderating effects of different contexts indicated that perceived enjoyment played a more important role in influencing intention for the leisure context, while perceived usefulness appeared to be more important for the work context. This study's findings are important in that they provide strong support for the necessity of distinguishing among different types of contexts when predicting users' intentions to use video calling. Furthermore, the results showed that perceived enjoyment was most significantly influenced by perceived usefulness (β ≥ 0.61), followed by PEU (β ≥ 0.13). In summary, the roles of core TAM variables (especially perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness) and of external factors (subjective norms and personal innovativeness) differed between the leisure and work contexts. The implications of these findings are discussed.",0.5429447852760736
Sex matters: Hippocampal volume predicts individual differences in associative memory in cognitively normal older women but not men,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015931677&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00093&partnerID=40&md5=9a7370b29f85ef2faedc9ea4a9e0ecb2,"The hippocampus plays a prominent role in associative memory by supporting relational binding and recollection processes. Structural atrophy in the hippocampus is likely to induce associative memory deficits in older adults. Previous studies have primarily focused on average age-related differences in hippocampal structure and memory performance. To date, however, it remains unclear whether individual differences in hippocampal morphometry underlie differential associative memory performance, and whether there are sex differences in the structural correlates of associative memory in healthy older adults. Here, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to examine the extent to which gray matter volume (GMV) of the hippocampus predicts associative memory performance in cognitively normal older adults. Seventy-one participants completed a cued recall paired-associative learning test (PALT), which consists of novel associations and semantically related associations, and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We observed worse associative memory performance and larger variability for novel associations than for semantically related associations. The VBM results revealed that higher scores on associative memory for novel associations were related to greater hippocampal GMV across all older adults. When considering men and women separately, the correlation between hippocampal GMV and associative memory performance for novel associations reached significance only in older women. These findings suggest that hippocampal structural volumes may predict individual differences in novel associative memory in older women but not men. © 2017 Zheng, Li, Xiao, He, Zhang and Li.",0.5377777777777778

Two leading examples are examined: the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS). A heuristic framework of institutional change markers is applied to the analysis of nanotechnology research in both countries. We draw on bibliometric sources, interviews and secondary sources. We find that while the two Academies share a common past as the dominant research agents in their respective systems, their current positions and trajectories now differ. The nanotechnology case shows that CAS has adapted to China's modernisation, engaged in central government policy initiatives, and interacted with other research performers. CAS remains central to the Chinese research system, and has rejuvenated and expanded its resource base. RAS, on the contrary, has taken a protectionist stance: it still dominates the Russian research system and has a strong nanotechnology position, enforced by its gatekeeper control over journal publication. Nevertheless, RAS has faced difficulties in internal modernisation, leading to the external imposition of reforms and further role diminishment. The paper offers comparative insights into processes of institutional adaptation and highlights how key institutions can influence system transition. © 2016 The Author(s)",0.45365853658536587

To address this issue, a backward masking task was adopted, in which participants were first asked to categorize natural scenes of color photographs and line-drawings and then to rate the clarity of their visual experience on a Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS). The interstimulus interval between the scene and the mask was manipulated. The behavioral results showed that categorization accuracy increased with PAS ratings for both color photographs and line-drawings, with no difference in accuracy between the two types of images for each rating, indicating that the experience rating reflected visibility. Importantly, the event-related potential (ERP) results revealed that for correct trials, the early posterior N1 and anterior P2 components changed with the PAS ratings for color photographs, but did not vary with the PAS ratings for line-drawings, indicating that the N1 and P2 do not always correlate with subjective visual awareness. Moreover, for both types of images, the anterior N2 and posterior VAN changed with the PAS ratings in a linear way, while the LP changed with the PAS ratings in a non-linear way, suggesting that these components relate to different types of subjective awareness. The results reconcile the apparently contradictory predictions of different theories and help to resolve the current debate on neural correlates of visual awareness. © 2017 Fu, Liu, Dienes, Wu, Chen and Fu.",0.390625

In this experiment we explored the involvement of configural computations while processing positive and negative faces in an expression categorization task using artificial faces. Analyzing the reaction times (RTs), we found that happy faces were categorized more quickly than sad faces (PCA) and this effect disappeared for inverted faces. Event-related potentials (ERPs) data showed that the face-sensitive N170 component was larger for sad than for happy faces only at upright condition and that face inversion significantly enhanced N170 amplitudes only for happy faces. Moreover, the happy faces elicited shorter N170 latency than did the sad faces, whereas for inverted condition the N170 latency did not differ between happy and sad faces. Finally, the significant positive correlation between the RTs and the latency of the N170 was not found for N170 amplitudes. Because the configural computation was task-irrelevant in the present study, these behavioral and ERP data indicated that one of the sources of PCA is the configural analysis applied by default while categorizing facial emotions. © 2017 Song, Liu, Yao, Yan, Ding, Yan, Zhao and Xu.",0.4619289340101523

This study assessed the reliability and construct validity of the Chinese short 46-item version of the ZKPQ-III-R in a sample of adolescents and young adults. Methodology: A total of 1,019 Chinese adolescents and young adults completed the Chinese version of the original 89-item version ZKPQ-III-R and short 46-item version ZKPQ-III-R, self-report measures of depression, life satisfaction, and subjective health complaints (SHC), the Big Five personality traits, and a substance use risk profile. We explored the internal consistency of five dimensions of the short 46-item version ZKPQ-III-R and compared it with observations in previous studies of Chinese and other populations. The structure of the questionnaire was analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling. Results: The short 46-item version ZKPQ-III-R had adequate internal reliability for all five dimensions, with Cronbach's a coefficients of 0.63 to 0.84. The concurrent validity of the short 46-item version ZKPQ-III-R was supported by significant correlations with depression, life satisfaction, and SHC. The short 46-item version ZKPQ-III-R had better fit, similar reliability coefficients, and slightly better construct and convergent validity than the 89-item version.

However, neither biological functions of OXTR SNPs in ASD nor critical OXTR SNPs that determine oxytocin's effects on ASD remains known. Here, using a machine-learning algorithm that was designed to evaluate collective effects of multiple SNPs and automatically identify most informative SNPs, we examined relationships between 27 representative OXTR SNPs and six types of behavioral/neural response to oxytocin in ASD individuals. The oxytocin effects were extracted from our previous placebo-controlled within-participant clinical trial administering single-dose intranasal oxytocin to 38 high-functioning adult Japanese ASD males. Consequently, we identified six different SNP sets that could accurately predict the six different oxytocin efficacies, and confirmed the robustness of these SNP selections against variations of the datasets and analysis parameters. Moreover, major alleles of several prominent OXTR SNPs-including rs53576 and rs2254298-were found to have dissociable effects on the oxytocin efficacies. These findings suggest biological functions of the OXTR SNP variants on autistic oxytocin responses, and implied that clinical oxytocin efficacy may be genetically predicted before its actual administration, which would contribute to establishment of future precision medicines for ASD. © The Author (2016).

Depression was the strongest predictor of the psychological, energy, and mobility aspects of QOL with β = −.70 (p <.001), β = −.47 (p <.001), and β = −.44 (p <.001), respectively. Emotional social support was a significant predictor of depression (β = −.12, p <.001), mobility (β =.20, p <.001), energy (β =.15, p <.001), and psychological aspect (β =.06, p <.05). Informational social support was a significant predictor of mobility (β = −.08, p <.01), energy (β = −.06, p <.05), and psychological aspect (β = −.07, p <.001). Functional social support was only negatively associated with mobility (β = −.16, p <.01). Therefore, depression had a negative effect on physical (perceived mobility and energy) and psychological (positive/negative feelings, thinking, learning, memory, and concentration) aspects of QOL. Emotional social support had both direct and indirect effects (through its buffering effect on depression) on better QOL. However, the associations between informational social support and the three aspects of QOL were negative; and informational social support did not have a buffering effect on depression. Functional social support was negatively associated with mobility, which means provision of functional support to PLHIV may not necessarily be associated with better QOL. The findings confirm that HIV/AIDS care in China should consider the conceptual differences between emotional, informational, and functional support. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.5

The main objective of the MIRID model is to enable one to test how component processes influence the complex cognitive behavior in terms of the item parameters. The original MIRID model is, indeed, a fairly restricted model for a number of reasons. One of these restrictions is that the model treats items as fixed and does not fit measurement contexts where the concept of the random items is needed. In this article, random item approaches to the MIRID model are proposed, and both simulation and empirical studies to test and illustrate the random item MIRID models are conducted. The simulation and empirical studies show that the random item MIRID models provide more accurate estimates when substantial random errors exist, and thus these models may be more beneficial. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",0.5

Implied between-object actions affect response selection without knowledge about object functionality,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026774054&doi=10.1080%2f13506285.2017.1330792&partnerID=40&md5=cbf7b3b08764a2a5a3b9be68b598f908,"Potential interactions between objects affect response selection in action-related object pairs. The present paper aimed to examine whether this effect is conditional on the knowledge about object functionality, or whether action-related structures such as handles are sufficient. This issue was investigated by utilizing a paradigm established previously. They presented imperative central targets which overlapped with task-irrelevant object pairs and required speeded left/right responses to the targets. With this paradigm, two stable effects of implied actions between objects on response selection have been identified: an inhibitory effect on responses aligned with the passive object (e.g., a bowl in a bowl–spoon pair) and an advantage associated with responses aligned with the active objects (e.g., a spoon). The present paper utilized these two effects as the indexes of response selection in paired-object scenarios, and found that active–passive object pairs without established functionality (e.g., a saw and a bowl, Experiment 1) generated the same effects, suggesting that response selection does not rely on functionality knowledge of given object pairs. Further, the two effects were also observed in passive–passive object pairs with handles (e.g., a cup–nail pair), but not in those without a handle (e.g., a bowl–nail pair, Experiment 2), and remained when the active objects were replaced by novel objects with handle but no known functionality (Experiment 3), suggesting that the action-related structures of objects are sufficient to affect response selection. The present study empirically illustrated the automaticity and directness of the extraction of potential interaction between objects, probably based on the relative location of action-related structure of objects. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.4307692307692308
Electrophysiological correlates of familiarity and recollection in associative recognition: Contributions of perceptual and conceptual processing to unitization,2017,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015357291&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00125&partnerID=40&md5=b07afe43ad8644ffefc5754e4ba9b919,"It is generally accepted that associative recognition memory is supported by recollection. In addition, recent research indicates that familiarity can support associative memory, especially when two items are unitized into a single item. Both perceptual and conceptual manipulations can be used to unitize items, but few studies have compared these two methods of unitization directly. In the present study, we investigated the effects of familiarity and recollection on successful retrieval of items that were unitized perceptually or conceptually. Participants were instructed to remember either a Chinese two-character compound or unrelated word-pairs, which were presented simultaneously or sequentially. Participants were then asked to recognize whether word-pairs were intact or rearranged. Event-related potential (ERP) recordings were performed during the recognition phase of the study. Two-character compounds were better discriminated than unrelated word-pairs and simultaneous presentation was found to elicit better discrimination than sequential presentation for unrelated word-pairs only. ERP recordings indicated that the early intact/rearranged effects (FN400), typically associated with familiarity, were elicited in compound word-pairs with both simultaneous and sequential presentation, and in simultaneously presented unrelated word-pairs, but not in sequentially presented unrelated word-pairs. In contrast, the late positive complex (LPC) effects associated with recollection were elicited in all four conditions. Together, these results indicate that while the engagement of familiarity in associative recognition is affected by both perceptual and conceptual unitization, conceptual unitization promotes a higher level of unitization (LOU). In addition, the engagement of recollection was not affected by unitized manipulations. It should be noted, however, that due to experimental design, the effects presented here may be due to semantic rather than episodic memory and future studies should take this into consideration when manipulating rearranged pairs. © 2017 Li, Mao, Wang and Guo.",0.450354609929078

Adopting a qualitative case study approach, the current article explores how poem writing after reading and discussing multicultural picture books helps Korean kindergarten children develop an understanding of racial diversity and equality. As part of a large-scale research project on multicultural education in South Korea, this study focuses on data collected over a five-month period including participatory observations, in-depth interviews and written materials. Findings suggest that writing poetry can function as a means to foster children’s critical awareness of racial diversity and equality and can help them find their own identities.

Moral judgments on short-term sexual behaviors among Chinese college students: Exploring the roles of gender and physical attractiveness,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014026746&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00191&partnerID=40&md5=78f8775b3254cb706f99cb5dc14bbf1c,"This study primarily investigated the effects of gender and physical attractiveness on moral judgments on three typical kinds of short-term sexual behaviors (short-term fling, one-night stand, and hookup) in the Chinese culture context. A total of 120 university student subjects were presented with a series of stereotypically physically attractive (versus physically unattractive) photos before they rated the extent to which each of the three short-term sexual behaviors are morally acceptable. The results showed that male students judged all three behaviors to be more morally acceptable than female students did. Further analyses showed that this gender difference was moderated by the level of physical attractiveness. Under the high attractiveness condition, short-term flings and hookups were judged more morally acceptable by male students than by female students, but this gender difference was not significant under the low attractiveness condition. However, with regard to one-night stands, the data showed that male students judged this type of behavior to be more morally acceptable than did female students under the low attractiveness condition, while this gender difference was not significant under the high attractiveness condition. Thus, these findings further our understanding of how Chinese young people view different types of short-term sexual behaviors, and provide novel evidence regarding how physical attractiveness influences people's moral judgments on short-term sexual behaviors. © 2017 Xiao, Li and Zhu.",0.5161290322580645

As well as the United States and the major European countries, there are several crowdsourcing services in Japan. For research purpose, Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is the widely used platform among those services. Previous validation studies have shown many commonalities between MTurk workers and participants from traditional samples based on not only personality but also performance on reasoning tasks. The present study aims to extend these findings to non-MTurk (i.e., Japanese) crowdsourcing samples in which workers have different ethnic backgrounds from those of MTurk. We conducted three surveys (N = 426, 453, 167, respectively) designed to compare Japanese crowdsourcing workers and university students in terms of their demographics, personality traits, reasoning skills, and attention to instructions. The results generally align with previous studies and suggest that non-MTurk participants are also eligible for behavioral research. Furthermore, small screen devices are found to impair participants' attention to instructions. Several recommendations concerning this sample are presented. © 2017 Majima, Nishiyama, Nishihara and Hata.",0.44571428571428573
Intrinsic brain activity responsible for sex differences in shyness and social anxiety,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015751605&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00043&partnerID=40&md5=bfaca5b7eaf3d2bab54179fc8039b005,"Male and female show significant differences in important behavioral features such as shyness, yet the neural substrates of these differences remain poorly understood. Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that both shyness and social anxiety in healthy subjects are associated with increased activation in the fronto-limbic and cognitive control areas. However, it remains unknown whether these brain abnormalities would be shared by different genders. Therefore, in the current study, we used resting-state fMRI (r-fMRI) to investigate sex differences in intrinsic cerebral activity that may contribute to shyness and social anxiety. Sixty subjects (28 males, 32 females) participated in r-fMRI scans, and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were used to measure the spontaneous regional cerebral activity in all subjects. We first compared the differences between male and female both in the ALFF and fALFF and then we also examined the whole brain correlation between the ALFF/fALFF and the severity of shyness as well as social anxiety by genders. Referring to shyness measure, we found a significant positive correlation between shyness scores (CBSS) and ALFF/fALFF value in the frontoparietal control network and a negative correlation in the cingulo-insular network in female; while in male, there is no such correlation. For the social anxiety level, we found positive correlations between Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) scores and spontaneous activity in the frontal-limbic network in male and negative correlation between the frontal-parietal network; however, such correlation was not prominent in female. This pattern suggests that shy female individuals engaged a proactive control process, driven by a positive association with activity in frontoparietal network and negative association in cingulo-insular network, whereas social anxiety males relied more on a reactive control process, driven by a positive correlation of frontal-limbic network and negative correlation of frontoparietal network. Our results reveal that shyness or social anxiety is associated with disrupted spontaneous brain activity patterns and that these patterns are influenced by sex. © 2017 Yang, Zhou, Lama, Chen, Hu, Wang, Chen, Shi, Huang and Gong.",0.41284403669724773

Selective attention enhances beta-band cortical oscillation to speech under “cocktail-party” listening conditions,2017,23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014008034&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00034&partnerID=40&md5=0512d8be0ab98995157884e240d9bc7d,"Human listeners are able to selectively attend to target speech in a noisy environment with multiple-people talking. Using recordings of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), this study investigated how selective attention facilitates the cortical representation of target speech under a simulated “cocktail-party” listening condition with speech-on-speech masking. The result shows that the cortical representation of target-speech signals under the multiple-people talking condition was specifically improved by selective attention relative to the non-selective-attention listening condition, and the beta-band activity was most strongly modulated by selective attention. Moreover, measured with the Granger Causality value, selective attention to the single target speech in the mixed-speech complex enhanced the following four causal connectivities for the beta-band oscillation: the ones (1) from site FT7 to the right motor area, (2) from the left frontal area to the right motor area, (3) from the central frontal area to the right motor area, and (4) from the central frontal area to the right frontal area. However, the selective-attention-induced change in beta-band causal connectivity from the central frontal area to the right motor area, but not other beta-band causal connectivities, was significantly correlated with the selective-attention-induced change in the cortical beta-band representation of target speech. These findings suggest that under the “cocktail-party” listening condition, the beta-band oscillation in EEGs to target speech is specifically facilitated by selective attention to the target speech that is embedded in the mixed-speech complex. The selective attention-induced unmasking of target speech may be associated with the improved beta-band functional connectivity from the central frontal area to the right motor area, suggesting a top-down attentional modulation of the speech-motor process. © 2017 Gao, Wang, Ding, Wang, Li, Wu, Qu and Li.",0.4200743494423792

The current report expands those previous findings to the 20 nationally or regionally representative WMH surveys that have now collected data on adult ADHD. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was administered to 26,744 respondents in these surveys in high-, upper-middle-, and low-/lower-middle-income countries (68.5% mean response rate). Current DSM-IV/CIDI adult ADHD prevalence averaged 2.8% across surveys and was higher in high (3.6%)- and upper-middle (3.0%)- than low-/lower-middle (1.4%)-income countries. Conditional prevalence of current ADHD averaged 57.0% among childhood cases and 41.1% among childhood subthreshold cases. Adult ADHD was significantly related to being male, previously married, and low education. Adult ADHD was highly comorbid with DSM-IV/CIDI anxiety, mood, behavior, and substance disorders and significantly associated with role impairments (days out of role, impaired cognition, and social interactions) when controlling for comorbidities. Treatment seeking was low in all countries and targeted largely to comorbid conditions rather than to ADHD. These results show that adult ADHD is prevalent, seriously impairing, and highly comorbid but vastly under-recognized and undertreated across countries and cultures. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",0.4486486486486487

Nevertheless, it remains unknown which brain region controls generation of spontaneous eyeblinks. To investigate this issue, the present study examined brain anatomy, which reflects inter-individual variability in eyeblink rate using structural magnetic resonance images with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in 57 participants. The gray matter volume of the right angular gyrus (rAG) was positively associated with an increased eyeblink rate. Next, we examined whether eyeblink rate decreased when activity in the rAG was disrupted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with a protocol of continuous theta burst stimulation: TMS of the rAG decreased eyeblink rate by 16%. In contrast, sham stimulation did not significantly affect eyeblink rate. The results from the structural MRI and TMS experiments suggest that the rAG is involved in controlling the generation of spontaneous eyeblinks in humans. © 2017 The Author(s)",0.42758620689655175

In this study, we aimed to explore the association between grit and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in 217 healthy adolescent students using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RSfMRI). We found that an individual's grit was negatively related to the regional fALFF in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), which is involved in self-regulation, planning, goal setting and maintenance, and counterfactual thinking for reflecting on past failures. The results persisted even after the effects of general intelligence and the 'big five' personality traits were adjusted for. More importantly, the fALFF of the right DMPFC played a mediating role in the association between grit and academic performance. Overall, these findings reveal regional fALFF as a neural basis of grit and highlight the right DMPFC as a neural link between grit and academic performance. © The Author (2016).

The roles of the anterior cingulate cortex and its dopamine receptors in self-paced cost–benefit decision making in rats,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986292307&doi=10.3758%2fs13420-016-0243-0&partnerID=40&md5=df96d8787e6eced68596f71d88e85002,"It has been shown that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and its dopamine system are crucial for decision making that requires physical/emotional effort, but not for all forms of cost–benefit decision making. Previous studies had mostly employed behavioral tasks with two competing cost–reward options that were preset by the experimenters. However, few studies have been conducted using scenarios in which the subjects have full control over the energy/time expenditure required to obtain a proportional reward. Here, we assessed the roles of the ACC and its dopamine system in cost–benefit decision making by utilizing a “do more get more” (DMGM) task and a time–reward trade-off (TRTO) task, wherein the animals were able to self-determine how much effort or time to expend at a nosepoke operandum for a proportional reward. Our results showed that (1) ACC inactivation severely impaired DMGM task performance, with a reduction in the rate of correct responses and a decrease in the effort expended, but did not affect the TRTO task; and (2) blocking ACC D2 receptors had no impact on DMGM task performance in the baseline cost–benefit scenario, but it significantly reduced the attempts to invest increased effort for a large reward when the benefit–cost ratio was reduced by half. In contrast, blocking ACC D1 receptors had no effect on DMGM task performance. These findings suggest that the ACC is required for self-paced effort-based but not for time–reward trade-off decision making. Furthermore, ACC dopamine D2 but not D1 receptors are involved in DMGM decision making. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.42570281124497994

Similarly, humans have a capacity for infinite natural numbers, while all other species seem to lack such a capacity (Gelman and Gallistel, 1978; Dehaene, 1997). Thus, the origin of this numerical capacity and its relation to language have been of much interdisciplinary interest in developmental and behavioral psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and linguistics (Dehaene, 1997; Hauser et al., 2002; Pica et al., 2004). Hauser et al. (2002) and Chomsky (2008) hypothesize that a recursive generative operation that is central to the computational system of language (called Merge) can give rise to the successor function in a set-theoretic fashion, from which capacities for discretely infinite natural numbers may be derived. However, a careful look at two domains in language, grammatical number and numerals, reveals no trace of the successor function. Following behavioral and neuropsychological evidence that there are two core systems of number cognition innately available, a core system of representation of large, approximate numerical magnitudes and a core system of precise representation of distinct small numbers (Feigenson et al., 2004), I argue that grammatical number reflects the core system of precise representation of distinct small numbers alone. In contrast, numeral systems arise from integrating the pre-existing two core systems of number and the human language faculty. To the extent that my arguments are correct, linguistic representations of number, grammatical number, and numerals do not incorporate anything like the successor function. © 2017 Hiraiwa.",0.430327868852459

Our findings confirm that mentoring top leaders positively relates to their perceived innovativeness of the organization and that the relationship is mediated by these leaders' perception of psychological safety within the organization. Our findings also confirm that the relationship is negatively moderated by these leaders' cognitive adaptability. The reliability and validity of the results have been proved by using confirmatory factor analysis and advanced regression analytics. As a result, this work demonstrates the value of mentoring top leadership and advocates the importance of establishing a psychologically safe environment to inspire not only top leadership to try new avenues but also for all those within the organization to speak up and speak out. Additionally, our findings encourage organizations to proactively and selectively prioritize mentoring among top leadership, taking into account their differing levels of cognitive adaptability.

Thus, it is necessary to explore and predict the onset of AD in MCI stage. In this study, we propose a combination of independent component analysis (ICA) and the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model to investigate promising risk factors associated with MCI conversion among 126 MCI converters and 108 MCI non-converters from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data, we extracted brain networks from AD and normal control groups via ICA and then constructed Cox models that included network-based neuroimaging factors for the MCI group. We carried out five separate Cox analyses and the two-modality neuroimaging Cox model identified three significant network-based risk factors with higher prediction performance (accuracy = 73.50%) than those in either single-modality model (accuracy = 68.80%). Additionally, the results of the comprehensive Cox model, including significant neuroimaging factors and clinical variables, demonstrated that MCI individuals with reduced gray matter volume in a temporal lobe-related network of structural MRI [hazard ratio (HR) = 8.29E-05 (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.10E-07 ∼ 0.013)], low glucose metabolism in the posterior default mode network based on FDG-PET [HR = 0.066 (95% CI, 4.63E-03 ∼ 0.928)], positive apolipoprotein E ε4-status [HR = 1. 988 (95% CI, 1.531 ∼ 2.581)], increased Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale scores [HR = 1.100 (95% CI, 1.059 ∼ 1.144)] and Sum of Boxes of Clinical Dementia Rating scores [HR = 1.622 (95% CI, 1.364 ∼ 1.930)] were more likely to convert to AD within 36 months after baselines. These significant risk factors in such comprehensive Cox model had the best prediction ability (accuracy = 84.62%, sensitivity = 86.51%, specificity = 82.41%) compared to either neuroimaging factors or clinical variables alone.

After a one-week baseline period, subjects received either 5 μg of ramosetron (n = 47) or placebo (n = 51) once daily for 12 weeks. To evaluate ""clinically meaningful improvements focusing on the severity of major IBS symptoms,"" the Japanese version of the IBS severity index (IBSSI-J) was used. Results: Change in IBSSI-J overall score from baseline was -133.5 ± 110.72 in the ramosetron 5 μg group and -108.2 ± 94.44 in the placebo group (P = 0.228) at the last evaluation point. Differences in responder rates for at least a 50% reduction from baseline in IBSSI-J between the ramosetron 5 μg group and the placebo group were over 10%, except Month 1. The monthly responder rate for global assessment of relief of overall IBS symptoms in the ramosetron 5 μg group showed a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo at the second month (44.4% vs 18.4%, P = 0.012). The proportion of patients who had a ≥ 50% reduction in IBSSI-J overall score was 24/37 (64.9%) in the responder group on global assessment and 18/54 (33.3%) in the non-responder group at Week 12. Conclusions: Further examination will be needed before IBSSI-J can be used in clinical trials of agents for IBS-D. However, this study revealed that response on global assessment was correlated with improvement in the IBSSI-J, suggesting that global assessment reflects improvement of the symptom severity of patients with IBS-D.

High-resolution audio with inaudible high-frequency components induces a relaxed attentional state without conscious awareness,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014048956&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00093&partnerID=40&md5=a01707362236aa2b0d47b1b7fbb43014,"High-resolution audio has a higher sampling frequency and a greater bit depth than conventional low-resolution audio such as compact disks. The higher sampling frequency enables inaudible sound components (above 20 kHz) that are cut offin low-resolution audio to be reproduced. Previous studies of high-resolution audio have mainly focused on the effect of such high-frequency components. It is known that alpha-band power in a human electroencephalogram (EEG) is larger when the inaudible high-frequency components are present than when they are absent. Traditionally, alpha-band EEG activity has been associated with arousal level. However, no previous studies have explored whether sound sources with high-frequency components affect the arousal level of listeners. The present study examined this possibility by having 22 participants listen to two types of a 400-s musical excerpt of French Suite No. 5 by J. S. Bach (on cembalo, 24-bit quantization, 192 kHz A/D sampling), with or without inaudible high-frequency components, while performing a visual vigilance task. High-alpha (10.5-13 Hz) and low-beta (13-20 Hz) EEG powers were larger for the excerpt with high-frequency components than for the excerpt without them. Reaction times and error rates did not change during the task and were not different between the excerpts. The amplitude of the P3 component elicited by target stimuli in the vigilance task increased in the second half of the listening period for the excerpt with high-frequency components, whereas no such P3 amplitude change was observed for the other excerpt without them. The participants did not distinguish between these excerpts in terms of sound quality. Only a subjective rating of inactive pleasantness after listening was higher for the excerpt with high-frequency components than for the other excerpt. The present study shows that high-resolution audio that retains high-frequency components has an advantage over similar and indistinguishable digital sound sources in which such components are artificially cut off, suggesting that high-resolution audio with inaudible high-frequency components induces a relaxed attentional state without conscious awareness. © 2017 Kuribayashi and Nittono.",0.35962145110410093
Preference for Dynamic Human Images and Gaze-Following Abilities in Preterm Infants at 6 and 12 Months of Age: An Eye-Tracking Study,2017,28,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962677514&doi=10.1111%2finfa.12144&partnerID=40&md5=e9dcd755dece26f1d4ded5d66cdcffd0,"Preterm children are reported to be at higher risk of social communication problems such as autism spectrum disorder compared with full-term infants. Although previous studies have suggested that preference for social stimuli in infancy is a possible indicator of later social communication development, little is known about this relation in preterm infants. We examined the gaze behavior of low-risk preterm and full-term infants at 6 and 12 months' corrected ages using two types of eye-tracking tasks, which measured 1) preference for social stimuli by biological motion and human geometric preference and 2) ability to follow another's gaze direction. We found that preterm (compared with full-term) infants at both 6 and 12 months of age spent less time looking toward dynamic human images, followed another's gaze less frequently, and looked for a shorter time at an object cued by another. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between looking time toward dynamic human images and frequency of gaze following at 12 months of age in full-term, but not preterm, infants. We discuss the relation between the atypical patterns of gaze behavior in preterm infants and their higher risk of later social communication problems.

Modulation of auditory evoked magnetic fields elicited by successive frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014047227&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00036&partnerID=40&md5=7ade3e4f1a5fa572b3accb9877182cb6,"In our daily life, we are successively exposed to frequency-modulated (FM) sounds that play an important role in speech and species-specific communication. Previous studies demonstrated that repetitive exposure to identical pure tones resulted in decreased neural activity. However, the effects of repetitively presented FM sounds on neural activity in the human auditory cortex remain unclear. In the present study, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate auditory evoked N1mresponses elicited by four successive temporally repeated and superimposed FM sweeps in three sequences: (1) four FM sweeps were identical, (2) four FM sweeps had the same FM direction and rate, but different carrier frequencies, (3) four FM sweeps differed with respect to the FM rate and/or direction and their carrier frequencies. In contrast to our expectations, the results obtained demonstrated that N1m responses were maximal when the four FM sweeps were identical and minimal when they were distinct. These results suggest that the neural processing of repetitive FM sweeps in the human auditory cortex may differ from that of repetitive pure tones. © 2017 Okamoto and Kakigi.",0.4911242603550296
The role of religious advisors in mental health care in the World Mental Health surveys,2017,21,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994318663&doi=10.1007%2fs00127-016-1290-8&partnerID=40&md5=568b56f25d8856492636bba066b8fdd1,"Objectives: To examine the role of religious advisors in mental health care (MHC) according to disorder severity, socio-demographics, religious involvement and country income groups. Methods: Face to face household surveys in ten high income (HI), six upper-middle income (UMI) and five low/lower-middle (LLMI) income countries totalling 101,258 adults interviewed with the WMH CIDI plus questions on use of care for mental health problems and religiosity. Results: 1.1% of participants turned to religious providers for MHC in the past year. Among those using services, 12.3% used religious services; as much as 30% in some LLMI countries, around 20% in some UMI; in the HI income countries USA, Germany, Italy and Japan are between 15 and 10% whenever the remaining countries are much lower. In LLMI 20.9% used religious advisors for the most severe mental disorders compared to 12.3 in UMI and 9.5% in HI. For severe cases most of religious providers use occurred together with formal care except in Nigeria, Iraq and Ukraine where, respectively, 41.6, 25.7 and 17.7% of such services are outside any formal care. Frequency of attendance at religious services was a strong predictor of religious provider usage OR 6.5 for those who attended over once a week (p < 0.0001); as seeking comfort “often” through religion in case of difficulties OR was 3.6 (p = 0.004) while gender and individual income did not predict use of religious advisors nor did the type of religious affiliation; in contrast young people use them more as well as divorced and widowed OR 1.4 (p = 0.02). Some country differences persisted after controlling for all these factors. Conclusions: Religious advisors play an important role in mental health care and require appropriate training and collaboration with formal mental healthcare systems. Religious attitudes are strong predictors of religious advisors usage. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0.5071942446043165
Risk assessment of neonatal exposure to low frequency noise based on balance in mice,2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014042291&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00030&partnerID=40&md5=037f620a9c0baff3d552dc0e13759a84,"General electric devices and ventilation systems are known to generate low frequency noise (LFN) with frequencies of <100Hz. Previous studies showed that exposure to LFN caused impairments of balance in humans and mice during adulthood. On the other hand, a previous study showed that noise levels in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were greater than those in general home or office environments. Therefore, it is possible that neonates have a potential risk to be exposed to LFN in the NICU. However, the risk of neonatal exposure to LFN remains unclear in humans and mice. In this study, male ICR mice were exposed to LFN at 100 Hz for 4 weeks after birth and then subjected to rotarod and beam crossing tests in order to assess LFN-mediated risk of imbalance during the neonatal period. Exposure to LFN at 70 dB, but not exposure to LFN up to 60 dB, during the neonatal period significantly decreased performance scores for rotarod and beam crossing tests compared to the scores of the control group. The number of calbindin-positive hair cells in the saccule and utricle was decreased in mice exposed to LFN at 70 dB for 4 weeks in the neonatal phase. Cessation of exposure for 10 weeks did not result in recovery of the decreased performance in rotarod and beam crossing tests. Thus, our results suggest that 70 dB is a possible threshold for exposure to LFN for 4 weeks during the neonatal period causing unrecoverable imbalance in mice. © 2017 Ohgami, Oshino, Ninomiya, Li, Kato, Yajima and Kato.",0.4146341463414634

Here, we examined the progressive performance changes in a one-session modified serial reaction time task in 6-and 10-year-old children and adults. We found that rapid sequence learning, as reflected by reaction time (RT), was comparable between groups. The learning was expressed through two behavioral processes: online progressive changes in RT while the task was performed in a continuous manner and offline changes in RT that emerged following a short rest. These offline and online RT changes were age-related; learning in 6-year-olds was primarily reflected through the offline process. In contrast, learning in adults was reflected through the online process; and both online and offline processes occurred concurrently in 10-year-olds. Our results suggest that early rapid sequence learning has a developmental profile. Although the unifying mechanism underlying these two age-related processes is unclear, we discuss possible explanations that need to be systematically elucidated in future studies. © 2017 Du, Valentini, Kim, Whitall and Clark.",0.42696629213483145

The aim of this study was to validate a culturally adapted Chinese version of the PHE-s (CPHE-s). Three hundred and seventy-seven participants were recruited from eight community health centers in a sample of patients with chronic disease in Hunan Province, China. The original Italian PHE-s was translated into Mandarin Chinese using a standardized forward-backward translation. The Rasch model was utilized and presented uni-dimensionality and good items fitness of the PHE-s. The internal consistency was 0.89 and the weighted Kappa coefficients of the items (test-retest reliability) ranged from 0.52 to 0.79. Both principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis supported a single-factor structure of the PHE-s. In testing the external validity, the PHE-s showed a significant moderate correlation with patient activation but not with medicine adherence behavior, which requires further exploration. The result suggested that the PHE-s is a reliable and valid instrument to assess the level of patient engagement in his or her own health management among chronic patients in China. Further analysis of reliability and validity should be assessed among other patient cohorts in China, and future directions for testing changes after patient engagement interventions should be developed by exploring some clinical relevance. © 2017 Zhang, Graffigna, Bonanomi, Choi, Barello, Mao and Feng.",0.4594594594594595

Methods Cross-sectional analyses were performed using data from 415 adolescents who participated in the 2015 follow-up of the Childhood Health Activity and Motor Performance School Study Denmark (the CHAMPS-study DK). Physical activity was objectively measured by accelerometry monitors. Serum BDNF levels were analyzed using the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anthropometrics and pubertal status were measured using standardized procedures. Results With adjustment for age, pubertal status and body mass index, mean physical activity (counts per minute) was negatively associated with serum BDNF in boys (P = 0.013). Similarly, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was negatively associated with serum BDNF in boys (P = 0.035). In girls, mean physical activity and MVPA were not associated with serum BDNF. Without adjustment for wear time, sedentary time was not associated with serum BDNF in either sex. Conclusion These findings indicate that higher physical activity is associated with lower serum BDNF in boys, but not in girls. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.49122807017543857

However, there is scope for signaller–recipient interchangeability in systems where most signals are potentially relevant to all age–sex groups, such as great ape gestural communication. In this study of wild bonobos (Pan paniscus), we aimed to discover whether their gestural communication is indeed a mutually understood communicative repertoire, in which all individuals can act as both signallers and recipients. While past studies have only examined the expressed repertoire, the set of gesture types that a signaller deploys, we also examined the understood repertoire, the set of gestures to which a recipient reacts in a way that satisfies the signaller. We found that most of the gestural repertoire was both expressed and understood by all age and sex groups, with few exceptions, suggesting that during their lifetimes all individuals may use and understand all gesture types. Indeed, as the number of overall gesture instances increased, so did the proportion of individuals estimated to both express and understand a gesture type. We compared the community repertoire of bonobos to that of chimpanzees, finding an 88 % overlap. Observed differences are consistent with sampling effects generated by the species’ different social systems, and it is thus possible that the repertoire of gesture types available to Pan is determined biologically. © 2016, The Author(s).",0.4345991561181435

However, most studies on the relationship between job crafting and employees' well-being have been conducted in western countries; thus, it is unclear whether job crafting can be effectively applied to Asian cultures, such as Japan, which emphasizes group harmony. The aim of this study was to examine the cross-sectional associations of self-reported job crafting with work engagement and psychological distress among employees in Japan. Method: A questionnaire survey through the internet was conducted among all employees of a manufacturing company in Japan. We analyzed the data from 894 respondents, all employees with regular employment. Job crafting, work engagement, and psychological distress were assessed using the Japanese version of the Job Crafting Questionnaire, the Japanese version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), and the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ), respectively. Result: Hierarchical multiple regression showed that increasing structural job resources, social job resources, and challenging job demands was significantly and positively associated with work engagement (β = 0.31, p < 0.001; β = 0.14, p < 0.001; β = 0.36, p < 0.001, respectively). For psychological distress, increasing structural job resources was significantly and negatively associated with psychological distress (β = -0.15, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study suggests that increasing structural job resources is associated with higher work engagement and lower psychological distress. In addition, increasing social job resources and challenging job demands are also associated with higher work engagement. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.5021834061135371

Data are drawn from the Children’s Worlds study (www.isciweb.org), which surveyed children in diverse national contexts. A model of subjective well-being is proposed which our analysis indicates is comparable across the two countries, including children’s ratings of their well-being in the domains of their local community, school, family, their family’s economic situation, and their overall subjective well-being. The model is a stronger predictor of subjective well-being in South Korea than in the UK, suggesting that these variables better capture the factors influencing variation between children in the South Korean context. However, the comparability of the models indicates that there is a core of similarity between the lives of children in these two very different contexts. This supports the value of studies such as the Children’s Worlds survey as enhancing our understanding of the meaning and experience of childhood in diverse contexts. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0.367816091954023

Participants were presented with pictures of members of a Japanese idol group inside an functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner while performing an unrelated detection task, and subsequently (outside the scanner) performed an incentive-compatible choice task that revealed their attitude toward each celebrity.We used a real-world election scheme that exists for this idol group, which confirmed both strongly negative and strongly positive attitudes toward specific individuals. Whole-brain multivariate analyses (searchlight-based support vector regression) showed that activation patterns in the anterior striatum predicted each participant's revealed attitudes (choice behavior) using leave-one-out (as well as 4-fold) cross-validation across participants. In contrast, attitude extremity (unsigned magnitude) could be decoded from a distinct region in the posterior striatum. The findings demonstrate dissociable striatal representations of valenced attitude and attitude extremity and constitute a first step toward an objective and process-pure neural measure of attitudes. © The Author (2016).

While risk is a ubiquitous part of modern life, there is limited research on the relationship between risk and prosocial behavior. In the present experiment, we empirically test whether risk has an influence on social discounting. We use the choice titration procedure to examine this effect. Our data show that independent of risk, participants are less eager to forego money and exhibit more selfishness toward a specific person when the social distance increases; these findings are reflected in the hyperbolic model. Interestingly, risk influences the shape of the social discounting function, which is reflected in the notable different discount rates. Individuals who make decisions under risk yield a smaller discount rate than those who make decisions without risk, i.e., under risk subjects reduce less their generosity as a function of the social distance. Furthermore, this distinct type of generosity occurs typically among individuals with 10-distance recipients but not with the closest- and furthest-social-distance recipients. © 2017 Jin, Pei and Ma.",0.4842105263157895

However, the extent to which factors of arousal and contextual information influence the positivity bias in older adults remains to be determined. Methods: In this study, 27 Chinese younger adults (20.00 ± 1.75 years) and 33 Chinese older adults (70.76 ± 5.49) learned pictures with negative, positive, and neutral valences. Half of the pictures had a human context, and the other half did not. In addition, emotional dimensions of negative and positive pictures were divided into high-arousal and low-arousal. The experimental task was to provide old/new recognition and confidence rating judgments. Results: Both groups of subjects showed the positivity bias for low-arousal pictures, but the positivity bias was restricted to low-arousal pictures without the human context in older adults. In addition, the positivity bias was mainly driven by the recollection process in younger adults, and it was mainly driven by both the recollection and familiarity processes in older adults. The recognition of the nonhuman positive pictures was correlated with cognitive control abilities, but the recognition of pictures with human contexts was correlated with general memory abilities in older adults. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of arousal and contextual information in modulating emotional memory in younger and older adults. It suggests that there are different mechanisms for memorizing pictures with and without human contexts in older adults. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0.5188284518828452

Despite progress in aggression research, its persistence among adolescents living in rural areas remains to be investigated. We evaluate the prevalence of aggression and the association between stressful life events and aggression in a nationwide, school-based sample of adolescents living in rural areas of China. Methods A sample of 13,495 Chinese rural students (7065 boys and 6430 girls; 11–20 years old) was selected from 15 representative rural areas from 5 provinces in China using stratified randomized cluster sampling. Aggression, stressful life events, neglect, emotional management, social support, and demographic characteristics were assessed via self-report questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate the association of stressful life events and aggression after controlling for confounds. Results The prevalence of aggressive behavior among Chinese adolescents living in rural areas was 24.3%. Regression analyses indicated that the odds of aggression were negatively influenced by chronic long-term stressors related to interpersonal problems (OR=2.03, 95% CI [1.75–2.36]), health adaptation difficulties (OR=1.21, 95% CI [1.09–1.34]), and other troubles (OR=1.93, 95% CI [1.74–2.14]), even after adjustment for parental neglect, emotional management, social support, and other relevant factors. Limitations This study was cross-sectional; thus, it is necessary to validate the causal relationship between stressful life events and aggression via follow-up studies. Conclusions Aggression was prevalent among Chinese adolescents living in rural areas, and interpersonal problems, health adaption difficulties, and other troubles were considered potential independent risk factors for aggression. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0.5064935064935064

Previous studies suggested that the frequency dependence between blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals may convey meaningful information regarding interactions between brain regions. Methods: In this article, we introduced a novel frequency clustering analysis method based on Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) and a label-replacement procedure. First, the time series from multiple predefined regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted. Second, each time series was decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by using HHT. Third, the improved k-means clustering method using a label-replacement method was applied to the data of each subject to classify the ROIs into different classes. Results: Two independent resting-state fMRI dataset of healthy subjects were analyzed to test the efficacy of method. The results show almost identical clusters when applied to different runs of a dataset or to different datasets, indicating a stable performance of our framework. Conclusions and Significance: Our framework provided a novel measure for functional segregation of the brain according to time-frequency characteristics of resting state BOLD activities. © 2017 Wu, Wu, Liu, Wen and Yao.",0.4473684210526316

But how well are observers able to interactively adjust the light properties on a ""probe object"" to its surrounding real scene? Image ambiguities can result in perceptual interactions between light properties. Such interactions formed a major problem for the ""readability"" of the illumination direction and diffuseness on a matte smooth spherical probe. We found that light direction and diffuseness judgments using a rough sphere as probe were slightly more accurate than when using a smooth sphere, due to the three-dimensional (3D) texture.We here extended the previous work by testing independent and simultaneous (i.e., the light field properties separated one by one or blended together) adjustments of light intensity, direction, and diffuseness using a rough probe. Independently inferred light intensities were close to the veridical values, and the simultaneously inferred light intensity interacted somewhat with the light direction and diffuseness. The independently inferred light directions showed no statistical difference with the simultaneously inferred directions. The light diffuseness inferences correlated with but contracted around medium veridical values. In summary, observers were able to adjust the basic light properties through both independent and simultaneous adjustments. The light intensity, direction, and diffuseness are well ""readable"" from our rough probe. Our method allows ""tuning the light"" (adjustment of its spatial distribution) in interfaces for lighting design or perception research. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.46946564885496184
Nature or nurture? A meta-analysis of the factors that maximize the prediction of digital piracy by using social cognitive theory as a framework,2017,68,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84996798710&doi=10.1016%2fj.chb.2016.11.015&partnerID=40&md5=bae2573cffb2a9d8d4f2a1fb2b2e5d27,"Digital piracy has permeated virtually every country and costs the global economy many billions of dollars annually. Digital piracy is the unauthorized and illegal digital copying or distribution of digital goods, such as music, movies, and software. To date, researchers have used disparate theories and models to understand individuals' motivations for stealing and sharing digital content. To establish a unified understanding of digital piracy research in order to set an agenda for future studies, we conducted a meta-analysis of the literature. We analyzed 257 unique studies with a total of 126,622 participants to examine all the major constructs and covariates used in the literature. Using social cognitive theory, we were able to resolve several contradictions and trade-offs found in the digital piracy literature. Further, our meta-analytic results suggest that four key sets of factors maximize prediction: (1) outcome expectancies (considerations of rewards, perceived risks, and perceived sanctions), (2) social learning (positive and negative social influence and piracy habit), (3) self-efficacy and self-regulation (perceived behavioral control and low self-control), and (4) moral disengagement (morality, immorality, and neutralization). Based on our results, we describe several patterns in the literature that suggest opportunities to further synthesize the literature and expand the boundaries of digital piracy research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0.5226130653266332

However, in spite of recent research advances on kin influence and birth order effects on human infant and child mortality, studies that directly examine the interaction of kin context and birth order on sibling differences in child mortality are still rare. Our study supplements this literature with new findings from large-scale individual-level panel data for three East Asian historical populations from northeast China (1789–1909), northeast Japan (1716–1870), and north Taiwan (1906–1945), where preference for sons and first-borns is common. We examine and compare male child mortality risks by presence/absence of co-resident parents, grandparents, and other kin, as well as their interaction effects with birth order. We apply discrete-time event-history analysis on over 172,000 observations of 69,125 boys aged 1–9 years old. We find that in all three populations, while the presence of parents is important for child survival, it is more beneficial to first/early-borns than to later-borns. Effects of other co-resident kin are however null or inconsistent between populations. Our findings underscore the importance of birth order in understanding how differential parental investment may produce child survival differentials between siblings. © 2016 The Authors",0.478494623655914
Dual identity and prejudice: The moderating role of group boundary permeability,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014032014&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00195&partnerID=40&md5=722e26cd712a64ce26eef58facb518d0,"Past work suggested that dual identity was effective to reduce prejudice. This study extended research on dual identity and prejudice by identifying a boundary condition in this relationship, that is, group permeability. In Study 1, we replicated previous studies with Chinese individuals and found that inducing dual identity (emphasizing subgroup differences and a common nation identity), compared to the control condition, decreased the urban residents' prejudice against rural-to-urban migrants. In Study 2, we manipulated the group boundary permeability using the Hukou system reform, and found that when the group boundary was permeable, dual identity was effective in reducing prejudice against rural-to-urban migrants. However, this effect vanished in the condition where the group boundary was impermeable. These results point to the importance of inducing dual identity under specific conditions for research on decreasing prejudice. Some practical implications of the findings for urbanization and immigration are discussed. © 2017 Shi, Dang, Zheng and Liu.",0.5405405405405406

While it brings us convenience and efficiency, its overuse can cause problems. Although a great number of studies have demonstrated that people affected by substance abuse, pathological gambling, and internet addiction disorder have lower self-control than average, scarcely any study has investigated the decision making of smartphone high users by using a behavioral paradigm. The present study employed an intertemporal task, the Smartphone Addiction Inventory (SPAI) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11th version (BIS-11) to explore the decision control of smartphone high users in a sample of 125 college students. Participants were divided into three groups according to their SPAI scores. The upper third (69 or higher), middle third (from 61 to 68) and lower third (60 or lower) of scores were defined as high smartphone users, medium users and low users, respectively. We compared the percentage of small immediate reward/penalty choices in different conditions between the three groups. Relative to the low users group, high users and medium users were more inclined to request an immediate monetary reward. Moreover, for the two dimensions of time and money in intertemporal choice, high users and medium users showed a bias in intertemporal choice task among most of the time points and value magnitude compared to low users. These findings demonstrated that smartphone overuse was associated with problematic decision-making, a pattern similar to that seen in persons affected by a variety of addictions. © 2017 Tang, Zhang, Yan and Qu.",0.46473029045643155

Visual working memory capacity can be increased by training on distractor filtering efficiency,2017,25,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014057133&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00196&partnerID=40&md5=3d72a4a890d1a43ab25da8f01c8015d3,"It is generally considered that working memory (WM) capacity is limited and that WM capacity affects cognitive processes. Distractor filtering efficiency has been suggested to be an important factor in determining the visual working memory (VWM) capacity of individuals. In the present study, we investigated whether training in visual filtering efficiency (FE) could improve VWM capacity, as measured by performance on the change detection task (CDT) and changes of contralateral delay activity (CDA) (contralateral delay activity) of different conditions, and evaluated the transfer effect of visual FE training on verbal WM and fluid intelligence, as indexed by performance on the verbal WM span task and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test, respectively. Participants were divided into high- and low-capacity groups based on their performance in a CDT designed to test VWM capacity, and then the low-capacity individuals received 20 days of FE training. The training significantly improved the group's performance in the CDT, and their CDA models of different conditions became more similar with high capacity group, and the effect generalized to improve verbal WM span. These gains were maintained at a 3-month follow-up test. Participants' RSPM scores were not changed by the training. These findings support the notion that WM capacity is determined, at least in part, by distractor FE and can be enhanced through training. © 2017 Li, He, Wang, Hu and Guo.",0.44594594594594594

This study focuses on R&D planning support programs, which are one of the policies designed to provide indirect support and improve investment efficiency. This study compares cases of R&D planning support programs in Korea to identify the differences between demanding companies and beneficiary companies and evaluates whether the implementation of the policy was efficient. To compare the characteristics of differing groups of companies, we applied an analysis method based on data mining to profile the characteristics of the companies. In addition, to help improve the efficiency of policy implementation in the future, we used discriminant analysis to present a model for forecasting how high the demand for R&D planning support will be among start-up companies. Based on the model we propose in this study, companies that have experienced R&D planning support have a very different profile from those that are in need of planning support. In other words, we found a mismatch between companies that have been beneficiaries of the policy and demanding companies, those that are still in need of the support. This study proposes a demand forecasting model to redress this mismatch, which we hope will contribute to enhancing the efficiency of R&D support policies and the evidence based decision making. © 2016 The Author(s)",0.4845814977973568
Combined reality therapy and mindfulness meditation decrease intertemporal decisional impulsivity in young adults with Internet gaming disorder,2017,70,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84998694504&doi=10.1016%2fj.chb.2016.11.038&partnerID=40&md5=0680395b354654afe186c3539a57f9c4,"Decisional impulsivity represents an important phenotype and a therapeutic target in Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Reality therapy and mindfulness meditation were two approaches to reduce impulsivity. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a group behavioral intervention combining reality therapy and mindfulness meditation in reducing decisional impulsivity and IGD severity. Twenty-five IGD and 21 healthy comparison (HC) young adults participated in baseline tests on the delay discounting and balloon analog risk tasks to measure intertemporal and risky decision-making respectively. Among them, 18 IGD subjects participated in the intervention and were tested again at the end of intervention, and 19 HC subjects without intervention were also tested twice within a similar time period. Results indicate that: (1) at baseline, IGD subjects showed greater intertemporal and risky decisional impulsivity than HC subjects; (2) After intervention, IGD subjects were decreased in delay discounting rate and IGD severity, but did not perform differently on decisional impulsivity in risky choices, as compared with baseline. These findings suggest that decisional impulsivity is a multifaceted behavioral construct and may serve as a possible therapeutic target for IGD. In addition, these results highlight the need for further research into the roles of different forms of decisional impulsivity in the shaping, maintenance, and remission of IGD. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0.40487804878048783

While this belief is prevalent, the psychological bases of such judgments on speed of time have remained unclear. In this study, we tested following two hypotheses: (1) the passage of time judgment (POTJ) is a function of the discrepancy between felt duration and temporal expectation of events and (2) POTJ is based on two distinct components: post hoc comparison of expected and felt durations and online anticipation of the end of an event. In four experiments, participants engaged in N-back tasks for several minutes and rated their POTJ during the tasks. Their temporal expectations were manipulated by providing them with false instructions on task durations. The results consistently supported the hypotheses and confirmed the idea that temporal expectation plays an important role in POTJ.

However, its intrinsic neural mechanism is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to assess abnormal spontaneous brain activity and to explicate the intricate neural mechanism of PMS using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). Materials and Methods: The data of 20 PMS patients (PMS group) and 21 healthy controls (HC group) were analyzed by regional homogeneity (ReHo) method during the late luteal phase of menstrual cycle. In addition, all the participants were asked to complete a daily record of severity of problems (DRSP) questionnaire. Results: Compared with HC group, the results showed that PMS group had increased ReHo mainly in the bilateral precuneus, left inferior temporal cortex (ITC), right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and left middle frontal cortex (MFC) and decreased ReHo in the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) at the luteal phase. Moreover, the PMS group had higher DRSP scores, and the DRSP scores positively correlated with ReHo in left MFC and negatively correlated with ReHo in the right ACC. Conclusion: Our results suggest that abnormal spontaneous brain activity is found in PMS patients and the severity of symptom is specifically related to the left MFC and right ACC.

Our approach takes advantage of intrinsic linearity that is inherent in the components of the NIRS time series to adopt a one-step regression strategy. We demonstrate the correctness of our approach through its mathematical analysis.

The neuropsychological features of depressive elderly with early-onset BD are largely unknown. This issue is relevant because cognitive impairment can produce an additional impact on the already compromised functionality of elderly with BD. The aim of this study is to assess executive functions (EFs) in the depressive phase of elderly outpatients with early-onset BD. Methods: Forty-nine elderly outpatients with early-onset BD were assessed with several neuropsychological tests for EF in the depressive phase of the disorder. Results: Executive dysfunction is very common in old age bipolar depression. Thirteen patients (26.5%) had a pseudodementia presentation. The worst performances were observed in the following tests: Trail Making B, Stroop Test 3, Backward Digit Span and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Conclusion: Executive dysfunction profile in elderly BD is complex and heterogeneous, but most cases display difficulties in working memory, inhibitory control, mental flexibility, and information processing speed. The performance of elderly with bipolar depression in executive assessment can be divided into two main categories: (1) Single EF domain impairment; and (2) Multiple EF domain impairment with or without a pseudodementia syndrome. Executive dysfunction in old age bipolar depression may be explained by lack of sufficient mental energy to run those cognitive processes that require larger amounts of effort to be performed. © 2017 Caixeta, Soares, Vieira, Soares, Caixeta, Ferreira and Aversi-Ferreira.",0.42290748898678415

The results of characteristics in the subjective ratings indicated that loss-evoked sadness was only associated with expressive words relating to tears. For the results of physiological measures, skin conductance levels (SCLs) increased during the imagery task across all conditions and differed between conditions during the post-task. For the loss condition, restoration to baseline level took longer, while in the failure the SCL decreased sharply back to baseline. Furthermore, tear ratings correlated with blood pressures in the loss condition, while sadness intensity correlated with blood pressures in the failure condition.

Previous research suggested that the visual dominance effect implicated the prioritizing of visual information into the motor system. In order to further reveal the underpinning neurophysiological mechanism of how visual information is prioritized into the motor system when vision dominates audition, the present study examined the time course of a particular motor activation ERP component, the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), during multisensory competition. The onsets of both stimulus-locked LRP (S-LRP) and response-locked LRP (R-LRP) were measured. Results showed that, the R-LRP onset to the auditory target was delayed about 91 ms when it was paired with a simultaneous presented visual target, compared to that when it was presented by itself. For the visual target, however, the R-LRP onset was comparable irrespective of whether it was paired with an auditory target or not. No significant difference was obtained for the onset of S-LRP. Taken together, the time courses of LRPs indicated that visual information was preferentially processed within the motor system, which coincides with the previous finding that the dorsal visual stream prioritizes the flow of visual information into the motor system. © 2017 Li, Liu, Zhang, Huang, Zhang, Liu and Chen.",0.41346153846153844

Triads were instructed to jump around different geometrical arrangements of hoops. The symmetry of the hoop geometry was manipulated to create two symmetrical and two asymmetrical participant-hoop configurations. Video and motion tracking recordings were employed to determine the frequencies of coordination misses (collisions or failed jumps) and during 20 successful jump sequences, the jump direction chosen (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) and the patterning of between participant temporal movement lags within and across jump events. The results revealed that the (a)symmetry of the joint action workspace significantly influenced the (a)symmetry of the jump direction dynamics and, more importantly, the (a)symmetry of the between participant coordination lags. The symmetrical participant-hoop configurations resulted in smaller overall movement lags and a more spontaneous, interchangeable leader/follower relationship between participants, whereas the asymmetrical participant-hoop configurations resulted in slightly larger overall movements lags and a more explicit, persistent asymmetry in the leader/follower relationship of participants. The degree to which the patterns of behavioral coordination that emerged were consistent with the theory of symmetry groups and spontaneous and explicit symmetry-breaking are discussed. © 2017 Kijima, Shima, Okumura, Yamamoto and Richardson.",0.4362745098039216

Methods: The scale has been translated from its original English version to Chinese by a team of native Chinese speakers in agreement with an expert highly trained in the use of the original version of the CRS-R and, then, back-translated to English by four independent translators blinded to the original version. The resulting translation has been sent to the original author for final approval. Results and conclusion: The Chinese version of the CRS-R is now available for use in clinical practise. Further investigations will nevertheless be needed in order to show that its psychometric properties are identical to the original English version. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",0.38636363636363635
"Pitch perception in the first year of life, a comparison of lexical tones and musical pitch",2017,23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016995323&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00297&partnerID=40&md5=cf99f073235af0e567648b2e9f4ae260,"Pitch variation is pervasive in speech, regardless of the language to which infants are exposed. Lexical tone is influenced by general sensitivity to pitch. We examined whether the development in lexical tone perception may develop in parallel with perception of pitch in other cognitive domains namely music. Using a visual fixation paradigm, 100 and one 4- and 12-month-old Dutch infants were tested on their discrimination of Chinese rising and dipping lexical tones as well as comparable three-note musical pitch contours. The 4-month-old infants failed to show a discrimination effect in either condition, whereas the 12-month-old infants succeeded in both conditions. These results suggest that lexical tone perception may reflect and relate to general pitch perception abilities, which may serve as a basis for developing more complex language and musical skills. © 2017 Chen, Stevens and Kager.",0.5
Lack of β2-AR increases anxiety-like behaviors and rewarding properties of cocaine,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015630115&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00049&partnerID=40&md5=c2b255b2ec81dc5fa953e0deacfd5b73,"It is well known that β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs) play a critical role in emotional arousal and stressful events, but the specific contributions of the β2-AR subtype to the psychological disorders are largely unknown. To investigate whether β2-AR are involved in anxiety-like behavior and reward to addictive drugs, we conducted a series of behavioral tests on β2-AR knock-out (KO) mice. β2-AR KO mice exhibited increased preference for the dark compartment and closed arm in tests of Light/Dark box and elevated plus maze, indicating that β2-AR deletion elevates level of anxiety or innate fear. β2-AR KO mice also showed decreased immobility in tail suspension test (TST), suggesting that β2-AR deletion inhibits depression-like behavior. Interestingly, β2-AR ablation did not change basal locomotion but significantly increased locomotor activity induced by acute cocaine administration. β2-AR KO mice showed enhanced place preference for cocaine, which could be attenuated by β1-selective AR antagonist betaxolol. Consistently, β2-AR agonist suppressed cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP). These data indicate that β2-AR deletion enhances acute response and reward to cocaine. Our results suggest that β2-AR regulates anxiety level, depression-like behavior and hedonic properties of cocaine, implicating that β2-AR are the potential targets for the treatment of emotional disorders and cocaine addiction. © 2017 Zhu, Liu, Zhou, Yin, Xu, Ma and Liu.",0.39805825242718446
Development of a recumbent isometric yoga program for patients with severe chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: A pilot study to assess feasibility and efficacy,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014420305&doi=10.1186%2fs13030-017-0090-z&partnerID=40&md5=7aee44971e71bdf7d6734175f4931e77,"Background: Our previous randomized controlled trial demonstrated that isometric yoga in a sitting position reduces fatigue in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). However, some patients experience difficulties sitting or practicing isometric yoga in a sitting position for long periods. To date, therapeutic interventions for patients with severe symptoms have not been established. Therefore, we developed a recumbent isometric yoga program, which takes approximately 20 min to complete, designed to reduce fatigue in patients with severe CFS/ME. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and usefulness of this program. Methods: This pilot study included 12 adult patients with CFS/ME. Six patients were reluctant to practice isometric yoga in a sitting position because of the severity of their fatigue (group 1). The remaining six patients had previously practiced isometric yoga in a sitting position (group 2). For 3 months, the patients of both groups practiced recumbent isometric yoga every 2 to 4 weeks with a yoga instructor and at home on other days if they could. The short-term effects of isometric yoga on fatigue were assessed using the Profile of Mood Status (POMS) questionnaire immediately before and after their final session with the yoga instructor. The long-term effects of isometric yoga on fatigue were assessed using the Chalder Fatigue Scale (FS) questionnaire before and after the intervention period. Adverse events, satisfaction with the program, and preference of yoga position (sitting or recumbent) were also recorded. Results: All subjects completed the intervention. In both groups, the POMS fatigue score was significantly decreased after practicing the 20-min yoga program and the Chalder FS score was decreased significantly after the 3-month intervention period. There were no serious adverse events. All subjects in group 2 preferred the recumbent isometric yoga program over a sitting yoga program. Conclusions: This study suggests that recumbent isometric yoga is a feasible and acceptable treatment for patients with CFS/ME, even for patients who experience difficulty practicing isometric yoga in the sitting position. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.3944099378881988
Directional bias in the perception of cast shadows,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014386009&doi=10.1177%2f2041669516682267&partnerID=40&md5=10516db8501a46b5fd4435c2380c96aa,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the perception of shading is based upon assumptions about lighting direction, for example, light from above. However, it is not clear whether these assumptions are used in the perception of cast shadows. Moreover, it is unclear whether a perceptual interaction exists between shading and cast shadows because until now they have been studied separately. In this study, we investigated through three experiments whether the light-from-above (or another direction) assumption is used in interpreting ambiguous cast shadows, and whether shading information influences the interpretation of cast shadows. Our results indicate the existence of the light-from-above assumption in interpreting cast shadows. Consistent shading information enhanced the interpretation, and judgments of lighting direction were also based on both cast shadow and shading information. However, the perceptual determination of shape from shading was relatively independent of the cast shadow interpretation or the lighting direction judgments of the scene. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.37748344370860926
Influences of cognitive processing capacities on speech perception in young adults,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014053637&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00266&partnerID=40&md5=b02a96971207ce99eb5c1a13f108ab58,"Foreign accent in speech often presents listeners with challenging listening conditions. Consequently, listeners may need to draw on additional cognitive resources in order to perceive and comprehend such speech. Previous research has shown that, for older adults, executive functions predicted perception of speech material spoken in a novel, artificially created (and therefore unfamiliar) accent. The present study investigates the influences of executive functions, information processing speed, and working memory on perception of unfamiliar foreign accented speech, in healthy young adults. The results showed that the executive processes of inhibition and switching, as well as information processing speed predict response times to both accented and standard sentence stimuli, while inhibition and information processing speed predict speed of responding to accented word stimuli. Inhibition and switching further predict accuracy in responding to accented word and standard sentence stimuli that has increased processing demand (i.e., nonwords and sentences with unexpected semantic content). These findings suggest that stronger abilities in aspects of cognitive functioning may be helpful for matching variable pronunciations of speech sounds to stored representations, for example by being able to manage the activation of incorrect competing representations and shifting to other possible matches. © 2017 Tao and Taft.",0.5128205128205128
Variation in event-related potentials by state transitions,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016017026&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00075&partnerID=40&md5=4866ee353581f2d7984efbfdd4b1e1c6,"The probability of an event’s occurrence affects event-related potentials (ERPs) on electroencephalograms. The relation between probability and potentials has been discussed by using a quantity called surprise that represents the self-information that humans receive from the event. Previous studies have estimated surprise based on the probability distribution in a stationary state. Our hypothesis is that state transitions also play an important role in the estimation of surprise. In this study, we compare the effects of surprise on the ERPs based on two models that generate an event sequence: a model of a stationary state and a model with state transitions. To compare these effects, we generate the event sequences with Markov chains to avoid a situation that the state transition probability converges with the stationary probability by the accumulation of the event observations. Our trial-by-trial model-based analysis showed that the stationary probability better explains the P3b component and the state transition probability better explains the P3a component. The effect on P3a suggests that the internal model, which is constantly and automatically generated by the human brain to estimate the probability distribution of the events, approximates the model with state transitions because Bayesian surprise, which represents the degree of updating of the internal model, is highly reflected in P3a. The global effect reflected in P3b, however, may not be related to the internal model because P3b depends on the stationary probability distribution. The results suggest that an internal model can represent state transitions and the global effect is generated by a different mechanism than the one for forming the internal model. © 2017 Higashi, Minami and Nakauchi.",0.4810606060606061
Motor Planning Influences the Perceived Timing of Vibrotactile Stimuli in an Amplitude-Dependent Manner,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981555694&doi=10.1080%2f00222895.2016.1169982&partnerID=40&md5=26535778785c98f25f1e8d32e83cfc76,"The authors characterized how motor planning influences temporal order judgment (TOJ) tasks. They examined this by applying vibrotactile stimulation during the planning stages of a bimanual arm movement that would bring the arms into a crossed configuration. The authors have previously shown that planning to cross the arms induces a subjective reversal of spatially defined temporal order judgments that evolves over the course of the planning period. It was unclear, however, whether this effect is modulated by the extent to which the arms would be crossed after movement. The authors examined this issue by having participants plan to move to 4 different targets that would leave the arms in crossed configurations of varying extents. The results demonstrate that even though cutaneous stimuli were applied before the movements, if participants were planning to move into a more crossed configuration, performance on the TOJ task worsened depending on where they were in the planning process. This data suggest the brain uses planning signals to predict sensations from impending movements in a context-dependent manner. © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Robert J.

The purpose of this study is to investigate linkages between physiological markers of MetS and life satisfaction, hostility, and depression in Chinese adults. Secondary analyses were conducted using cross-sectional data from parents of randomly selected middle school students participating in a pilot study in Qingdao, China. Among 440 parents who consented to participate (237 women, 203 men), 368 provided valid responses in all three categories of psychological characteristics, and only those subjects were included in these analyses. General linear models and logistic regressions were run separately by gender, controlling for covariates. Among women, life satisfaction was inversely associated with triglyceride levels (p =.04), LDL-C (p <.01), risk of hypertriglyceridemia (OR[.53], p <.01), HDL-C (OR[.78], p =.03), and MetS (OR[.52], p =.03). No associations were found between life satisfaction and any psychological characteristics among men. Among women, hostility was positively associated with triglyceride level (p =.04) and risk of hypertriglyceridemia (OR[2.12], p <.05). Among men, hostility was positively associated with waist circumference (p =.04), waist-hip ratio (p <.05), and fasting plasma insulin (p <.01). Depression was not associated with any physiological measurement in either gender. These findings indicate that relationships exist between certain psychological characteristics and physiological indicators of MetS among Chinese adults, although there may be important differences between genders. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.45045045045045046

Informing that strategy with empirical intelligence offers great potential value to R&D managers and technology policy makers. This paper proposes a methodology, based on patent analysis, to extract technical intelligence to identify M&A target technologies and evaluate relevant target companies to facilitate M&A target selection. We apply the term clumping process and a trend analysis together with policy and market information to profile present R&D status and capture future development signals and trends in order to grasp a range of significant domain-based technologies. Furthermore, a comparison between a selected acquirer and leading players is used to identify significant technologies and sub-technologies for specific strategy-oriented technology M&A activities. Finally, aiming to recommend appropriate M&A target companies, we set up an index-based system to evaluate the acquired target candidates from both firms-side perspective and target firm-side perspective and differentially weigh for specific M&A situations.

Relationship between divergent thinking and intelligence: An empirical study of the threshold hypothesis with Chinese children,2017,40,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014095235&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00254&partnerID=40&md5=3ced7eff4d0006c4c253ad66f1bb914d,"The threshold hypothesis is a classical and notable explanation for the relationship between creativity and intelligence. However, few empirical examinations of this theory exist, and the results are inconsistent. To test this hypothesis, this study investigated the relationship between divergent thinking (DT) and intelligence with a sample of 568 Chinese children aged between 11 and 13 years old using testing and questionnaire methods. The study focused on the breakpoint of intelligence and the moderation effect of openness on the relationship between intelligence and DT. The findings were as follows: (1) a breakpoint at the intelligence quotient (IQ) of 109.20 when investigating the relationship between either DT fluency or DT flexibility and intelligence. Another breakpoint was detected at the IQ of 116.80 concerning the correlation between originality and intelligence. The breakpoint of the relation between the composite score of creativity and intelligence occurred at the IQ of 110.10. (2) Openness to experience had a moderating effect on the correlation between the indicators of creativity and intelligence under the breakpoint. Above this point, however, the effect was not significant. The results suggested a relationship between DT and intelligence among Chinese children, which conforms to the threshold hypothesis. Besides, it remains necessary to explore the personality factors accounting for individual differences in the relationship between DT and intelligence. © 2017 Shi, Wang, Yang, Zhang and Xu.",0.45539906103286387

However, its precise function in this network remains unclear. It has recently been proposed that the dmPFCis involved in high-level abstract (i.e., categorical) identification or construction of both social and non-social stimuli, referred to as “high construal.” This was based on the observation of greater activation in the dmPFC shared by a high construal social condition (trait inference based on visually presented behavior) and a high construal non-social condition (categorization of visually presented objects) vs. matched lowconstrual conditions (visual description of the same pictures). However, dmPFC activation has been related to task contexts requiring responses based on self-guided generation of mental content or decisions as compared to responses more directly determined by the experimental context (e.g., free vs. rule-governed choice). The previously reported dmPFCactivity may reflect differences in task constraint (i.e., the extent to which the task context guided the process) confounded with the construal manipulation. Therefore, in the present study, we manipulated construal level and constraint independently, while participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As before, participants visually described (low level construal) or categorized (high level construal) pictures of objects. Orthogonal to this, the description or categorization task had to be performed on either one object (lowconstraint) or on two objects simultaneously (high constraint), limiting the number of possible responses. Statistical analysis revealed common greater activation in both high construal conditions (high and low constraint) than in their low construal counterparts, replicating the influence of construal level on dmPFC activation (greater involvement in high than low construal), but no influence of constraint. In line with previous proposals and earlier work, we suggest that the dmPFC is involved in high-construal abstraction across different domains. © 2017 Baetens, Ma and Van Overwalle.",0.46357615894039733

Our results show that (a) concentrated crackdowns are less effective and efficient than random controls; (b) prolonged crackdowns reduce fare-dodging during the period of intense monitoring but induce a burst of fraud as soon as they are withdrawn; (c) pre-announced controls induce more fraud in the periods without control. Overall, we also observe that real fare-dodgers fraud more in the experiment than non-fare-dodgers. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0.41830065359477125

However, more and more studies have questioned this theory because of dissociation between voluntary or involuntary spatial orienting and the IOR effect. To further explore the ""reorienting hypothesis"" of IOR, the present experiment employed an atypical cue-target paradigm which combined a spatially non-predictive peripheral cue that was presumed to trigger IOR with a spatially non-predictive central cue that was used to reflexively trigger a shift of attention. The results showed that a significant IOR effect did not interact with automatic spatial orienting as measured in mean RTs and accuracy as well as the Nd component. These findings suggested that the IOR effect triggered by peripheral cue was independent of automatic orienting generated by a central cue.

This extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker shifts between reading in depth and studying new domains. To study this decision-making process, we examine the reading choices made by one of the most celebrated scientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books listed in his chronologically-organized reading journals, we generate topic models to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading decisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a cognitively-validated, information-theoretic measure of relative surprise. Rather than a pattern of surprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin's behavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually high levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts, detected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual epochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin's own self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts with their publication order. We find Darwin's consumption more exploratory than the culture's production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal changes are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our quantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework for testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between short- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic modeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies of collective scientific behavior. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",0.4225941422594142

Results showed that the STCI-T<106> and the STCI-S<45> had high Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.60 to 0.92 in Mainland China, and the factorial structures of the instruments were supported. The STCI-T<60> and STCI-S<30> were developed utilizing three criteria for the selection of items. Cronbach alphas were satisfactory ranging from 0.67 to 0.94. The factor structure of the items appeared to be highly generalizable in Mainland China. Joint factor analyses of the state and trait items yielded three factors (cheerfulness, seriousness and bad mood) both as traits and states with the homologous concepts positively correlated. As expected, cheerfulness correlated negatively with bad mood, and cheerfulness correlated negatively with state seriousness. Meanwhile, seriousness correlated positively with bad mood. Moreover, life satisfaction was related positively with cheerfulness and negatively with bad mood, and could be predicted by high cheerfulness and low bad mood.

Furthermore, in Experiment 2, an orthogonal design of valence and arousal with neutral condition was employed to study the arousal-mechanism of temporal distortion effect and its difference between genders. The results showed that the gender difference observed in Experiment 1 was robust and was not influenced by valence and arousal. Taken together, our findings suggest a stable gender difference in the temporal perception of semantic stimuli, which might be related to some intrinsic properties of linguistic stimuli and sex differences in brain structure as well as physiological features.

Ease of availability of high-lethality suicide methods, such as pesticides and firearms, contributes to the overall incidence and is an important target for suicide prevention. This study investigates whether changes in the distribution of methods of suicide have contributed to the recent reduction in suicide in China. Method Suicide rates (2006–2013) were calculated using the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points system, stratified by gender, age group, and urban-rural residence, to investigate trends in suicide over the study period. Multilevel negative binomial regression models were used to investigate associations between socio-demographic factors and method-specific suicide. Results The most common method of suicide in China for both males and females was pesticide poisoning, followed by hanging. All methods declined over the study period, with the exception of suicide by jumping in males. Suicide rates for pesticide poisoning and for hanging increased exponentially with age in those aged over ≥45 years in both sexes. Pesticide poisoning declined from 55% to 49% of all suicides, while hanging increased from 27% to 31%. Limitations This was an ecological study of a time series of suicide rates, with risk factor adjustment being limited to population-level point estimates derived from a single census. Conclusions Suicide by pesticide poisoning and hanging remain the leading methods of suicide in China. Changes to the safe use of pesticides and targeted prevention initiatives to restrict access, along with socio-economic development and urbanisation, are likely contributors to declines in suicide by pesticide poisoning © 2016",0.4918032786885246
Teachers' accuracy in identifying ADHD status and their intended classroom management strategies for students with and without ADHD: A vignette study in South-Korea and Germany,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093124113&doi=10.5114%2fcipp.2017.66261&partnerID=40&md5=2bc1e29da0bbdf209f1a18e5fb550702,"background The purpose of this study was to investigate Korean and German teachers' accurate diagnosis and their intentions of using classroom management strategies (CMS) for the hypothetical student depicted in the vignette types. participants and procedure Through a disproportional stratified sampling procedure, matched 264 Korean and 264 German teachers were distributed. Kos (2004)' eight vignettes were slightly modified due to the different cultural background. SPSS 22.0 was used to analyze the data. results Within a culture, 68.20% of Korean and 48.90% of German teachers were able to correctly identify attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) status. Teachers in both countries intend to use emotional support the most, followed by proactive strategies. Across cultures, a significant difference was found between Korean and German teachers with regard to their accuracy in identifying students' ADHD status. Korean teachers showed higher accuracy than German teachers. Significant differences between the two countries were also observed regarding teachers' intentions of using corrective and proactive strategies. Korean teachers use more corrective strategies, and German teachers use more proactive strategies. Regarding emotional support, no significant differences were found between Korean and German teachers. conclusions This study can be a preliminary resource for developing a specific CMS for students with ADHD for both countries. It is suggested that the current status of teachers' specific CMS for students with ADHD should be investigated in order to develop more specialized CMS for these students. It is worth conducting a meta-analysis of this issue to assess the most effective CMS for students with ADHD in the classroom. © 2017 Current Issues in Personality Psychology.",0.5019762845849802
Prevalence and associated positive psychological variables of anxiety and depression among patients with central nervous system tumors in China: a cross-sectional study,2017,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963828920&doi=10.1002%2fpon.4128&partnerID=40&md5=6811ba99419e4e378c48f41572a3305d,"Background: Anxiety and depression have been identified as common psychological distresses faced by the majority of patients with cancer. However, no studies have investigated the relationship between positive psychological variables (hope, optimism and general self-efficacy) and anxiety and depression among patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors in China. Our hypothesis is that the patients with higher levels of hope, optimism or general self-efficacy have lower levels of anxiety and depression when encountered by stressful life events such as CNS tumors. Methods: Questionnaires, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Herth Hope Index, the Life Orientation Scale-Revised and the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and demographic and clinical records were used to collect information about patients with CNS tumors in Liaoning Province, China. The study included 222 patients (effective response rate: 66.1%). Hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to explore the associations among hope, optimism, general self-efficacy and anxiety/depression. Results: Prevalence of anxiety and depression were 42.8 and 32.4%, respectively, among patients with CNS tumors. Hope and optimism both were negatively associated with anxiety and together accounted for 21.4% of variance in anxiety. Similarly, hope and optimism both were negatively associated with depression and accounted for 32.4% of variance in depression. Conclusions: The high prevalence of anxiety and depression among patients with CNS tumors should receive more attention in Chinese medical settings. To help reduce anxiety and depression, health care professionals should develop interventions to promote hope and optimism based on patients' specific needs.

Results from a survey of customers of Mingdao, a leading Enterprise 2.0 platform in China, support our model. The research findings show that organizational and environmental context factors, including subjective norms and competitive pressure, significantly influence enterprises' intentions to renew their E2.0 service in addition to technology perceptions. Perceived usefulness and satisfaction are no longer the strongest predicators of continuance usage in the context of enterprise systems.

In order to fill this void, we investigate how job scope and career and development opportunities, two critical contextual factors, moderate the supervisory mentoring-affective commitment-turnover links. Integrating social exchange theory with insights from situational approaches to leadership, we hypothesized that (a) job scope would interact with supervisory mentoring in predicting affective commitment and (b) career and development opportunities would interact with affective commitment in predicting turnover such that the conditional effects of supervisory mentoring on turnover would be stronger at high levels of these contextual moderators. Results of a study conducted with a sample of 228 business alumni, using 15-month voluntary turnover as outcome, supported our predictions. We discuss the implications of these findings for mentoring research and practice. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.46099290780141844
Activation of the DLPFC reveals an asymmetric effect in risky decision making: Evidence from a tDCS study,2017,23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012050887&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00038&partnerID=40&md5=ae15e11c26f119ffaee52f1b56ac01bd,"The phenomenon of loss aversion (the tendency for losses to have a greater impact than comparable gains) has long been observed in daily life. Neurocognitive studies and brain imaging studies have shed light on the correlation between the phenomenon of loss aversion and the brain region of the prefrontal cortex. Recent brain stimulation studies using bilateral transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have obtained various results showing the causal relationship between brain regions and decision making. With the goal of studying whether unilateral stimulation can change participants' risky decision making in the frames of gains and losses, we applied different polarities of tDCS over the regions of the right or left prefrontal cortex. We also designed a risk measurement table (Multiple Price List) to reflect the participants' attitudes toward risky decision making via the crossover point including the frames of gains and losses. The results of our experiment indicated that the participants tended to be more risk averse in the gain frame after receiving left anodal tDCS and more risk seeking in the loss frame after receiving right cathodal tDCS, which was consistent with the hypothesis that the process of risky decision making was correlated with the interaction of multiple systems in the brain. Our conclusion revealed an asymmetric effect of right/left DLPFC when the participants faced gains and losses, which partially provided the neural evidence and a feasible paradigm to help better understand risky decision making and loss aversion.

Educational Expansion and the Role of Education in Expenditure Inequality in Indonesia Since the 1997 Financial Crisis,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84951767811&doi=10.1007%2fs11205-015-1208-y&partnerID=40&md5=59e27ec94a7ca932e78c8cff1f4af313,"Based on the National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas) from 1997 to 2011, this study examines the role of education in expenditure inequality in Indonesia under educational expansion since the 1997 financial crisis. This is achieved using the three decomposition methods: the Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition; the decomposition of the Gini coefficient; and the hierarchical decomposition of the Theil index. The expansion of education, particularly basic education in rural areas, appears to have not only lowered educational disparity between the urban and rural sectors but also educational inequality within the rural sector. Due in large part to the declining educational disparity between the urban and rural sectors, the urban–rural expenditure disparity has narrowed since the mid-2000s. On the other hand, the expansion of higher education in urban areas appears to have played an important role in the recent rise in overall expenditure inequality by raising not only disparity between educational groups but also inequality within the tertiary education group. Basic education policies would still serve as an effective means to mitigate expenditure inequality, as they could reduce not only educational gap between the urban and rural sectors but also educational inequality within the rural sector by raising general educational levels. Since the expansion of higher education in urban areas seems to be one of the main factors of the recent rise in overall expenditure inequality, higher education policies would also be crucial. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0.44541484716157204

To date, little is known about the distribution and expression of MANF in the retina and optic nerve (ON). Therefore, we studied the expression and distribution of MANF in the ON and retina by real-time PCR, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. Results from rat and mouse were highly consistent in the retina. MANF was detected in both tissues in rat, wherein it was principally localized to the ganglion cell layer (GCL), followed by the inner nuclear layer (INL). The MANF protein levels in the rat retina were 3.33-fold higher than in the rat ON. Additionally, MANF was robustly expressed by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the human retina. In human ON, MANF was partially co-localized with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), suggesting that it was not restricted to astrocytes. In vitro studies confirmed that MANF could be robustly expressed in RGCs and was found principally within the cytoplasm. Hypoxia can stimulate up-regulation by of MANF expression over time, suggesting that MANF may play a vital role in the functional regulation of RGCs both in health and disease. We believe that the present study improves our understanding of the distribution and expression of MANF in the retina and ON and could help in further analysis of its interact and correlate with the relevant ophthalmic diseases. © 2017 Gao, Zhang, Li, Wu and Wu.",0.33064516129032256

Recently, along with the advancement of bibliometrics, there have been particularly active attempts to forecast life cycles using technology documents such as news, paper publications, patents, etc. The present study uses web search traffic to forecast by analogy, which has newly emerged as a method of empirically verifying the life cycle of either a product or a technology. So as to explore the potential of the analogical forecasting method using search traffic, we compare the trends of changes in the life cycle with those of search traffic and compare aspects of the search traffic exhibited by both U.S. and Korean consumers over various products. The study results revealed that search traffic trends tended to precede the adoption of a new product; however it accounted for the trends of adoption over the full life-cycle very accurately. In addition, statistically significant relationships have been observed in the search traffic for the same technology even when the traffic originated from distinct nations, languages and web search engines. From the results therein, we judged that the search traffic-based, analogical forecast method would be effective, and applied it to a case for estimating the Korean Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) market. The most significant contribution of this study is that it presents the potential of utilizing search traffic as a new dimension for forecasting by analogy. © 2016 The Authors",0.3900414937759336
The Nursing Assessment of Medication Acceptance: the reliability and validity of a schizophrenia medication adherence scale,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123545998&doi=10.1177%2f2045125316672546&partnerID=40&md5=d8691d3c923d92cc779f9d991cbda4a3,"Background: Many patients with schizophrenia have low medication adherence. There is, however, no objective assessment scale that can be used by nurses or caregiver specialists. The Nursing Assessment of Medication Acceptance (NAMA) was developed to assess patients’ medication adherence. The aim of this study was to examine the validity and reliability of the NAMA in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 121 Japanese patients with schizophrenia were enrolled. All patients underwent evaluation using the NAMA and the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10). Reliability was investigated using a test-retest method and a parallel-test method. To determine the test-retest reliability of the NAMA, we tested 101 schizophrenia patients twice, with the second assessment 2–4 weeks after the date of the first assessment. For validity verification, standard-related validity and the degree of concordance with the DAI-10 scores were measured. Results: The Cronbach’s alpha value of the NAMA in schizophrenia was 0.88. The test-retest correlation coefficients were all between 0.53–0.74. The total scores and all subscores for the NAMA were significantly correlated, and the NAMA total scores were significantly correlated with the DAI-10 total scores. Conclusions: The NAMA shows good reliability and validity in measuring medication adherence in schizophrenia. © 2016, © The Author(s), 2016.",0.3489583333333333

Thus, chronic dysfunction of the OFC may cause symptoms of affective disorders, such as anxiety, depression and impulsivity. Previous studies have investigated the effect of orbitofrontal dysfunction on anxiety-like behavior and impulsive aggression in rodents, but the results are inconsistent possibly reflecting different methods of OFC inactivation. These studies used either a lesion of the OFC, which may affect other brain regions, or a transient inactivation of the OFC, whose effect may be restored in time and not reflect effects of chronic OFC dysfunction. In addition, there has been no study on the effect of orbitofrontal inactivation on depression-like behavior in rodents. Therefore, the present study examined whether chronic inactivation of the OFC by continuous infusion of a GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol, causes behavioral abnormalities in rats. Muscimol infusion inactivated the ventral and lateral part of the OFC. Following a week of OFC inactivation, the animals showed an increase in anxiety-like behavior in the open field test and light-dark test. Impulsive aggression was also augmented in the chronically OFC-inactivated animals because they showed increased frequency of fighting behavior induced by electric foot shock. On the other hand, chronic OFC inactivation reduced depression-like behavior as evaluated by the forced swim test. Additionally, it did not cause a significant change in corticosterone secretion in response to restraint stress. These data suggest that orbitofrontal neural activity is involved in the regulation of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and impulsive aggression in rodents. © 2017 Kuniishi, Ichisaka, Matsuda, Futora, Harada and Hata.",0.4

Considering this, a survey of well-being and travel-to-school behavior was carried out in four high schools of Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan; between May and September 2016 with 1,017 valid samples. The respondents’ ages vary between 15 and 19 years old. We argue that transport-based social exclusion results from not only situations of transport disadvantage, but also reduced or deteriorated individual well-being. Here, well-being is measured by using constructs grouped into three main categories: happiness, healthy lifestyle propensity, and social exclusion. We found the following potential issues of transport-based social exclusion: residents in depopulating areas experience lower levels of well-being than people in non-depopulating areas. Travel times longer than 30 minutes have negative effects on happiness, traffic safety perception, health conditions, and personal health habits. Bicycle users tend to experience higher levels of well-being in general, whereas bus and car users tend to experience less in comparison. Special attention should be paid to improving affordability and flexibility of bus services for students. © 2017 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",0.5202020202020202

In addition, the role of motivation as a modulating factor was examined. Participants (children, adolescents, and adults) completed two forms of the guess and application task (GAT). Feedback from the Cool-GAT task has low motivational salience because there are no consequences, while feedback from the Hot-GAT task has high motivational salience as it pertains to receiving a reward. The results indicated that negative feedback leads to a reduction in learning compared to positive feedback. The effect of negative feedback was greater in adolescent participants compared to children and adults in the Hot-GAT task, suggesting an interaction between age and motivation level on learning. Further analysis indicated that greater risk was associated with a greater reduction in learning from negative feedback and again, the reduction was greatest in adolescents. In summary, the current study supports the idea that learning from positive feedback and negative feedback differs throughout development. In a rule-based learning task, when associative learning is primarily in practice, participants learned less from negative feedback. This reduction is amplified during adolescence when task-elicited motivation is high. © 2017 Zhuang, Feng and Liao.",0.43283582089552236
A reduction in delay discounting by using episodic future imagination and the association with episodic memory capacity,2017,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010850460&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2016.00663&partnerID=40&md5=04deeaef55c35c87403af06d78220f8c,"Delay discounting (DD) refers to the phenomenon that individuals discount future consequences. Previous studies showed that future imagination reduces DD, which was mediated by functional connectivity between medial prefrontal valuation areas and a key region for episodic memory (hippocampus). Future imagination involves an initial period of construction and a later period of elaboration, with the more elaborative latter period recruiting more cortical regions. This study examined whether elaborative future imagination modulated DD, and if so, what are the underlying neural substrates. It was assumed that cortical areas contribute to the modulation effect during the later period of imagination. Since future imagination is supported by episodic memory capacity, we additionally hypothesize that the neural network underlying the modulation effect is related to individual episodic memory capacity. Twenty-two subjects received an extensive interview on personal future events, followed by an fMRI DD experiment with and without the need to perform elaborative future imagination simultaneously. Subjects’ episodic memory capacity was also assessed. Behavioral results replicate previous findings of a reduced discount rate in the DD plus imagination condition compared to the DD only condition. The behavioral effect positively correlated with: (i) subjective value signal changes in midline brain structures during the initial imagination period; and (ii) signal changes in left prefrontoparietal areas during the later imagination period. Generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses reveal positive correlations between the behavioral effect and functional connectivity among the following areas: right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left hippocampus; left inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and left hippocampus; and left IPC and bilateral occipital cortices. These changes in functional connectivity are also associated with episodic memory capacity. A hierarchical multiple regression indicates that the model with both the valuation related signal changes in the right ACC and the imagination related signal changes in the left IPC best predicts the reduction in DD. This study illustrates interactions between the left hippocampus and multiple cortical regions underlying the modulation effect of elaborative episodic future imagination, demonstrating, for the first time, empirical support for a relation to individual episodic memory capacity. © 2017 Hu, Kleinschmidt, Martin, Han, Thelen, Meiberth, Jessen and Weber.",0.47701149425287354
Repetitive religious chanting modulates the late-stage brain response to fear- and stress-provoking pictures,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012025950&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2016.02055&partnerID=40&md5=0186c36b5ddfca4cd0446489949dce43,"Chanting and praying are among the most popular religious activities, which are said to be able to alleviate people's negative emotions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this mental exercise and its temporal course have hardly been investigated. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the effects of chanting the name of a Buddha (Amitabha) on the brain's response to viewing negative pictures that were fear- and stress-provoking. We recorded and analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data from 21 Buddhists with chanting experience as they viewed negative and neutral pictures. Participants were instructed to chant the names of Amitabha or Santa Claus silently to themselves or simply remain silent (no-chanting condition) during picture viewing. To measure the physiological changes corresponding to negative emotions, electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response data were also collected. Results showed that viewing negative pictures (vs. neutral pictures) increased the amplitude of the N1 component in all the chanting conditions. The amplitude of late positive potential (LPP) also increased when the negative pictures were viewed under the no-chanting and the Santa Claus condition. However, increased LPP was not observed when chanting Amitabha. The ERP source analysis confirmed this finding and showed that increased LPP mainly originated from the central-parietal regions of the brain. In addition, the participants' heart rates decreased significantly when viewing negative pictures in the Santa Claus condition. The no-chanting condition had a similar decreasing trend although not significant. However, while chanting Amitabha and viewing negative pictures participants' heart rate did not differ significantly from that observed during neutral picture viewing. It is possible that the chanting of Amitabha might have helped the participants to develop a religious schema and neutralized the effect of the negative stimuli. These findings echo similar research findings on Christian religious practices and brain responses to negative stimuli. Hence, prayer/religious practices may have cross-cultural universality in emotion regulation. This study shows for the first time that Buddhist chanting, or in a broader sense, repetition of religious prayers will not modulate brain responses to negative stimuli during the early perceptual stage, but only during the late-stage emotional/cognitive processing. © 2017 Gao, Fan, Wu, Halkias, Chau, Fung, Chang, Zhang, Hung and Sik.",0.4309859154929577

However, it is unclear whether and how the latency of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) and MEP amplitude are affected by implicit and/or explicit motor learning. Here, we investigated the changes in M1 excitability and MEP latency induced by implicit and explicit motor learning. The subjects performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with their five fingers. In this task, visual cues were lit up sequentially along with a predetermined order. Through training, the subjects learned the order of sequence implicitly and explicitly. Before and after the SRTT, we recorded MEP at 25 stimulation points around the hot spot for the flexor pollicis brevis (FPB) muscle. Although no changes in MEP amplitude were observed in either session, we found increases in MEP latency and changes in histogram of MEP latency after implicit learning. Our results suggest that reorganization across the motor cortices occurs during the acquisition of implicit knowledge. In contrast, acquisition of explicit knowledge does not appear to induce the reorganization based on the measures we recorded. The fact that the above mentioned increases in MEP latency occurred without any alterations in MEP amplitude suggests that learning has different effects on different physiological signals. In conclusion, our results propose that analyzing a combination of some indices of M1 excitability, such as MEP amplitude and MEP latency, is encouraged in order to understand plasticity across motor cortices. © 2017 Hirano, Kubota, Koizume, Tanaka and Funase.",0.43568464730290457

Researchers have used various recruitment methods to reach this population hidden from the hetero-normative culture. To inform future recruitment strategies, we compared estimates of socio-demographic characteristics, HIV risk behaviors, depression, and intimate partner violence (IPV) across three samples of MSM and money boys in Shanghai, China. Data were collected from three community-based samples of MSM and money boys (n = 1352) recruited via respondent-driven sampling (RDS) (n = 404), community popular opinion leaders (CPOL) (n = 385), and Internet and venue-based sampling (VBS) (n = 546). Different recruitment methods generated samples with statistically significant differences among a number of socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, drug use, depression scores, and exposure to IPV. Specifically, RDS participants had lower education (p =.002), income levels (p <.001), and were more likely to report condomless sex with a woman (p <.001). CPOL participants were younger (p <.001), more likely to report lifetime condomless anal sex (p =.009), more than 10 male partners in the past 30 days (p <.001), and were less likely to experience violence by a male intimate partner (p =.001). VBS participants had lowest depression score (p =.005) and were more likely to report lifetime drug use (p =.003).

The effects of the binocular disparity differences between targets and maskers on visual search,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85004045226&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-016-1252-y&partnerID=40&md5=36c0a9416aafa088fe4fec1e678cb5e1,"A visual search for targets is facilitated when the target objects are on a different depth plane than other masking objects cluttering the scene. The ability of observers to determine whether one of four letters presented stereoscopically at four symmetrically located positions on the fixation plane differed from the other three was assessed when the target letters were masked by other randomly positioned and oriented letters appearing on the same depth plane as the target letters, or in front, or behind it. Three additional control maskers, derived from the letter maskers, were also presented on the same three depth planes: (1) random-phase maskers (same spectral amplitude composition as the letter masker but with the phase spectrum randomized); (2) random-pixel maskers (the locations of the letter maskers’ pixel amplitudes were randomized); (3) letter-fragment maskers (the same letters as in the letter masker but broken up into fragments). Performance improved with target duration when the target-letter plane was in front of the letter-masker plane, but not when the target letters were on the same plane as the masker, or behind it. A comparison of the results for the four different kinds of maskers indicated that maskers consisting of recognizable objects (letters or letter fragments) interfere more with search and comparison judgments than do visual noise maskers having the same spatial frequency profile and contrast. In addition, performance was poorer for letter maskers than for letter-masker fragments, suggesting that the letter maskers interfered more with performance than the letter-fragment maskers because of the lexical activity they elicit. © 2016, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4745098039215686

Participants were required to name pictures (ongoing task [OT]), and to remember to refrain from naming but instead give a different response to certain target cues (PM task). Although the OT was of comparable difficulty for both age groups (as indicated by no performance differences), results still indicated significantly higher PM performance in 5-year-olds than in 3-year-olds, confirming the age-related increase of PM capacities between 3 and 5 years. Furthermore, results showed a performance-enhancing effect of significant others as task instructors on both age-groups. Post-hoc analysis revealed that 3-year-olds instructed by a significant other still performed marginally worse than 5-year-olds instructed by a researcher, underlining the finding that substantial changes of PM capacities take place during early childhood. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.44025157232704404
Do young Chinese children gain anthropomorphism after exposure to personified touch-screen and board games?,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012050592&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00055&partnerID=40&md5=b7a03dddd69982e00d009b1a5a0afeed,"Research shows that preschoolers are likely to anthropomorphize not only animals, but also inanimate toy after being exposed to books that personify these objects. Can such an effect also arise through young children's use of touch-screen games? The present study is the first to examine whether playing a touch-screen personified train game affects young children's anthropomorphism of real trains. Seventy-nine 4- and 6-year-old children were randomly assigned to play either a touch-screen game or a board game of Thomas the Tank Engine for 10 min. They completed the Individual Differences in Anthropomorphism Questionnaire-Child Form (IDAQ-CF) (two subscales: Technology/Inanimate Nature, Animate Nature) and an additional four items about the anthropomorphism of real trains, before (T1) and after (T2) the game. Overall results showed that children manifested a small but statistically significant increase in anthropomorphizing of real trains after their exposure to both games, claiming that real trains were like humans. Interestingly, 4-year-old children in the board game group tended to anthropomorphize real trains more than those in the touch-screen group, whereas the reverse was true for the 6-year-old children. The results suggest that touch-screen games may delay the decline of children's anthropomorphism during the cognitive and socio-emotional transition that occurs in children aged 5-7. These findings have implications for future research on how touch-screen games increase children's anthropomorphism of the real world, and more generally, for evaluation of the influence of the growing use of touch-screen games on young children's learning. © 2017 Li, Hsueh, Wang, Bai, Liu and Zhou.",0.319672131147541
Curious people are less affected by social rejection,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991493956&doi=10.1016%2fj.paid.2016.10.006&partnerID=40&md5=fad280d2ce3808132c49bb69f09e1cfa,"Recent studies have revealed that curiosity—seeking new information and experiences—can improve psychological and social functioning. However, the social nature of curiosity remains poorly understood. We tested whether curious people show better psychological adaptation because (1) they have less rejection sensitivity, and (2) they are less susceptible to daily social rejection experiences. These two hypotheses were supported by a cross-sectional study (N = 500, 20–39 years old). We found that rejection sensitivity partially mediates the relationship between curiosity and psychological adaptation (life satisfaction and depression). Furthermore, curiosity moderated the relationships between perceived daily social rejection experiences and life satisfaction: Curious people are buffered against such aversive effects, relative to less curious people. Our findings suggest one possible explanation for why curious people experience better psychological functioning: They appear to be less affected by social rejection. © 2016",0.6511627906976745
Loneliness Predicts Insensitivity to Partner Commitment,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989298333&doi=10.1016%2fj.paid.2016.09.047&partnerID=40&md5=3378fb1460e4613aebe2f6bf4743935b,"People attend to their partners’ pro-relationship behaviors (or commitment signals) which in turn leads to a positive adjustment in perceived strength of interpersonal bonds. This bond-confirming effect is stronger when the commitment signal entails some high cost (e.g., receiving an expensive birthday present), and by contrast, it is weaker when the commitment signal entails a low cost (e.g., receiving a wish of “Happy Birthday”). The present study explored how loneliness moderates sensitivity to commitment signals as well as their absence (i.e., situations where partners fail to signal commitment despite the demands of the situation). Studies with a Japanese student sample (Study 1), a Japanese community sample (Study 2), and an American sample drawn from users of Amazon Mechanical Turk (Study 3) found that loneliness is associated with an insensitivity to commitment signals: The lonelier the participant, the less likely he or she was to positively adjust perceived bond strength in response to a commitment signal. This relative insensitivity was observed irrespective of the costliness of the signal. On the other hand, loneliness did not predict differences in sensitivity to the absence of commitment signals. Implications of these results for the loneliness literature are discussed. © 2016 The Author(s)",0.41968911917098445
Attachment avoidance is significantly related to attentional preference for infant faces: Evidence from eye movement data,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012094011&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00085&partnerID=40&md5=ad4fd360acf0816a088b5289c7865118,"Objective: To determine the influence of adult attachment orientations on infant preference. Methods: We adopted eye-tracking technology to monitor childless college women's eye movements when looking at pairs of faces, including one adult face (man or woman) and one infant face, with three different expressions (happy, sadness, and neutral). The participants (N = 150; 84% Han ethnicity) were aged 18-29 years (M = 19.22, SD = 1.72). A random intercepts multilevel linear regression analysis was used to assess the unique contribution of attachment avoidance, determined using the Experiences in Close Relationships scale, to preference for infant faces. Results: Women with higher attachment avoidance showed less infant preference, as shown by less sustained overt attentional bias to the infant face than the adult face based on fixation time and count. Conclusion: Adult attachment might be related to infant preference according to eye movement indices. Women with higher attachment avoidance may lack attentional preference for infant faces. The findings may aid the treatment and remediation of the interactions between children and mothers with insecure attachment. © 2017 Jia, Cheng, Zhang, Ta, Xia and Ding.",0.5290697674418605
Perception of Affordances for Striking Regulates Interpersonal Distance Maneuvers of Intermediate and Expert Players in Kendo Matches,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011342611&doi=10.1080%2f10407413.2017.1270147&partnerID=40&md5=ea2ac34df569e664702e37f7833f385c,"In daily life and in many sports, people must adjust interpersonal distance between themselves and others based on task constraints and goals. For example, in martial arts such as boxing and kendo, players must adjust interpersonal distance before starting or defending strikes. However, it is not clear what players perceive and how players use this perceptual information to maneuver interpersonal distance and start strikes during real matches. We investigated players' perception of affordances and the criteria for perception and behaviors, and how these change with expertise, using real kendo matches as a one-on-one opponent task. Players perceived affordances for striking for themselves and for their opponent based on subtle interpersonal distance changes and clearly switched stepping forward and backward. In addition, players perceived affordances for strike success and entered closer interpersonal distance than the possible striking distance to increase their own striking ability and exited the closer distance to decrease their opponent's striking ability, respectively. Furthermore, expert players stayed in and moved into the critical interpersonal distance more frequently than intermediate players did. Our research indicates a relationship between action-scaled affordance perception of and maneuvers associated with interpersonal distance in one-on-one situations that occur in daily life and in many sports. © 2017 The Author(s).

When late second language learners access the meaning of L2 words: Using ERPs to investigate the role of the L1 translation equivalent,2017,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988462492&doi=10.1016%2fj.jneuroling.2016.09.006&partnerID=40&md5=8cd554d1404b0361f45d82816435acf7,"According to the Revised Hierarchical Model (Kroll & Stewart, 1994), second language (L2) learners initially access the meaning of L2 words via the L1 whereas advanced learners access meaning directly. We tested this hypothesis with English learners of Spanish in a translation recognition task, in which participants were asked to judge whether English words were the correct translations of Spanish words. We gathered data on behavior and on the earliest time course of processing using ERPs. The critical conditions compared the performance of learners to reject distractors that were related to the translation in form or meaning when a long (750 ms) or short (300 ms) SOA separated the two words. The behavioral data revealed semantic and translation interference at both SOAs. The ERP data showed that at the long SOA, a larger P200, a smaller N400, and a larger LPC were elicited by semantic distractors. In addition, a larger P200 and a larger LPC were elicited by form distractors. At the short SOA, only a smaller N400 for semantic distractors was revealed. These results are remarkably similar to the pattern reported by Guo, Misra, Tam, and Kroll (2012) for relatively proficient Chinese-English bilinguals. Overall, these data suggest that even less proficient learners are able to access the meaning of the L2 word in comprehension without L1 mediation. © 2016",0.39436619718309857
Fear reduction without fear through reinforcement of neural activity that bypasses conscious exposure,2017,85,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013757178&doi=10.1038%2fs41562-016-0006&partnerID=40&md5=6ae5fb15ac4c09ebba36fd88cfc1fb33,"Fear conditioning is a fundamentally important and preserved process across species 1,2. In humans it is linked to fear-related disorders such as phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 3,4. Fear memories can be reduced by counter-conditioning, in which fear conditioned stimuli (CS+s) are repeatedly reinforced with reward 5 or with novel non-threatening stimuli 6. However, this procedure involves explicit presentations of CS+s, which is itself aversive before fear is successfully reduced. This aversiveness may be a problem when trying to translate such experimental paradigms into clinical settings 7. It also raises the fundamental question as to whether explicit presentations of feared objects is necessary for fear reduction 1,8. Although learning without explicit stimulus presentation has been previously demonstrated 9-12, whether fear can be reduced while avoiding explicit exposure to CS+s remains largely unknown. One recently developed approach employs an implicit method to induce learning by reinforcing stimulus-specific neural representations using real-time decoding of multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals 13-15 in the absence of stimulus presentation; that is, pairing rewards with the occurrences of multi-voxel brain activity patterns matching a specific stimulus (decoded fMRI neurofeedback (DecNef) 13,15). It has been shown that participants exhibit perceptual learning for a specific visual stimulus feature through DecNef, without being given any strategy for the induction of specific neural representations, and without awareness of the content of reinforced neural representations 13. Here we examined whether a similar approach could be applied to counter-conditioning of fear. We show that we can reduce fear towards CS+s by pairing rewards with the activation patterns in visual cortex representing a CS+, while participants remain unaware of the content and purpose of the procedure. This procedure may be an initial step towards novel treatments for fear-related disorders such as phobia and PTSD, via unconscious processing.",0.4250871080139373
Altered regional gray matter volume in obese men: A structural MRI study,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012111041&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00125&partnerID=40&md5=73ddc1c6059f8272eb0a938d7b9b1983,"Obesity is associated with a number of health problems, especial insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Our previous study showed that obese males had decreased neural activity in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and increased activity in the left putamen (Zhang et al., 2015b), which could indicate altered eating behaviors in obesity related to a hyper-functioning striatum and hypo-functioning inhibitory control. Accordingly, our goal of the current study was to determine whether there are alterations in the brain structures within these two neural systems in obese individuals. Twenty obese men (age: 20-28 years) and 20 age-matched lean male subjects were involved in the current study. Plasma glucose and insulin were tested during hunger state, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was based on the blood samples. In the study, we used structural MRI and a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method to investigate regional structures in obese subjects and find out whether there are correlations between the insulin and the brain structures. We found that obese men only showed a significantly increased gray matter volume (GMV) in the left putamen and that the GMV of the left putamen was positively correlated with body mass index, plasma insulin and HOMA-IR. The putamen is a core region participating in insulin signal regulation, and our results showed an abnormal GMV of the putamen is a core alternation in aberrant insulin. Furthermore, the GMV of the OFC was negatively correlated with hunger rating, despite there being no significant difference between the two groups in the OFC. In conclusion, the altered structure and function of the putamen could play important roles in obesity and aberrant insulin. © 2017 Zhang, Tian, Tian, Wang, Wang, Yu, Li and Wang.",0.4259927797833935

When two eye’s images only differ in luminance, observers may perceive shininess, a form of rivalry called binocular luster. Does dichoptic information guide attention in visual search? Wolfe and Franzel (Perception & Psychophysics, 44(1), 81–93, 1988) reported that rivalry could guide attention only weakly, but that luster (shininess) “popped out,” producing very shallow Reaction Time (RT) × Set Size functions. In this study, we have revisited the topic with new and improved stimuli. By using a checkerboard pattern in rivalry experiments, we found that search for rivalry can be more efficient (16 ms/item) than standard, rivalrous grating (30 ms/item). The checkerboard may reduce distracting orientation signals that masked the salience of rivalry between simple orthogonal gratings. Lustrous stimuli did not pop out when potential contrast and luminance artifacts were reduced. However, search efficiency was substantially improved when luster was added to the search target. Both rivalry and luster tasks can produce search asymmetries, as is characteristic of guiding features in search. These results suggest that interocular differences that produce rivalry or luster can guide attention, but these effects are relatively weak and can be hidden by other features like luminance and orientation in visual search tasks. © 2016, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4784688995215311
Rank among peers during game competition affects the tendency to make risky choices in adolescent males,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012072476&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00016&partnerID=40&md5=c158a01a1628cc901e7b997c2966a80b,"It has been shown that adolescents take more risks when they are with peers than when they are alone, presumably because the presence of peers can be a social reward/punishment that can bias decision making. Competition is inherent in peer interactions, and recent work has demonstrated that winning/losing is an intrinsic social reward/punishment. Taken together, it can be hypothesized that competition amongst peers affects adolescents' risky behavior. While there is much evidence that status amongst peers can relate to antisocial/aggressive behavior, it remains unclear whether risky behavior is affected. Moreover, the degree to which 'temporary status,' such as ranking in a short-term competitive game, affects behavior is uncertain, an important issue because adolescents might be sensitive to situations or factors which potentially destabilize existing hierarchies. In this experiment, these issues were directly explored in the classroom environment using smartphone technology and Wi-Fi setup. Male junior high school students (aged 14-15) performed a roulette game task on smartphones, playing either independently or against five classmates. In the latter case, the students' current ranks within the group of six were constantly presented on smartphone screens. To dissociate the effects of the students' reactions to ranks from their actual performances, unknown to the students, the ranks presented were actually predetermined so that about half of the students were continuously presented with high ranks whereas the other half were continuously presented with low ranks. We found that the students presented with low ranks made more risky plays than those not presented with ranks or those presented with high ranks. This result suggests that even temporary status significantly affects adolescents' risky behavior, and also demonstrates the usefulness of smartphones in examining and manipulating peer interactions in classroom experiments. © 2017 Foo, Nagase, Naramura-Ohno, Yoshiuchi, Yamamoto and Morita.",0.4013840830449827

One of these is the correct specification of the parametric part of the SMMs. Model checking is an important task for data analysts to detect any departure of an assumed model from the true one. However, little work has been done on the goodness-of-fit (GOF) test for the SMMs. In this article, we propose a global GOF test of SMMs. Numerical studies show the proposed test can control type I errors if the SMM is correctly specified. Furthermore, the proposed test detects non-linear effect modification of continuous covariates powerfully, while an existing test does not.

Participants performed a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) emotion discrimination task on each face. Behavioral analysis showed that participants were unaware of masked stimuli of which duration was the shortest and, therefore, processed at subthreshold. Nevertheless, women showed significantly larger response in P100 amplitude to subthreshold fearful faces than men. This result remained consistent in the control experiment.

The framing effect indicates that risk preference could be modulated by emotional messages contained in the description (i.e., frame) of options. The behavioral results have showed the classic framing effect. In addition, individual level of trait anxiety was positively correlated with the framing effect size. However, trait anxiety was not correlated with risk-avoidance ratio in any condition.

However, collecting genetic data poses a significant challenge for most population-based behavioral studies. The aim of this study was to assess the utilities of a pedigree-based proxy measure of genetic predisposition of drinking (GPD) and its effect on alcohol use behaviors as well as its interactions with personal and environmental factors. In the current study, cross-sectional data were collected from 700 female sex workers (FSW) in Guangxi, China. Participants provided information on a pedigree-based proxy measure of GPD and their alcohol use behaviors. Chi-square and independent t-test was applied for examining the bivariate associations between GPD and alcohol use behaviors; multivariate and ordinal regression models were used to examine the effect of GPD on alcohol use. This study found that women with a higher composite score of GPD tended to have a higher risk of alcohol use problem compared to their counterparts (p <.05). GPD was a significant predictor of alcohol use problems (p <.05), especially among women who had mental health issues or lack of health cares. The pedigree-based measure provided a useful proxy of GPD among participants. Both FSW’s mental health and health care access interact with GPD and affect their drinking patterns. By understanding the genetic basis of alcohol use, we can develop scalable and efficacious interventions that will take into consideration the individual risk profile and environmental influences. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.44534412955465585
Underlying skills of oral and silent reading fluency in Chinese: Perspective of visual rapid processing,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012030590&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2016.02082&partnerID=40&md5=cdd09d5de29b3ba34fc37ba8de63393f,"Reading fluency is a critical skill to improve the quality of our daily life and working efficiency. The majority of previous studies focused on oral reading fluency rather than silent reading fluency, which is a much more dominant reading mode that is used in middle and high school and for leisure reading. It is still unclear whether the oral and silent reading fluency involved the same underlying skills. To address this issue, the present study examined the relationship between the visual rapid processing and Chinese reading fluency in different modes. Fifty-eight undergraduate students took part in the experiment. The phantom contour paradigm and the visual 1-back task were adopted to measure the visual rapid temporal and simultaneous processing respectively. These two tasks reflected the temporal and spatial dimensions of visual rapid processing separately. We recorded the temporal threshold in the phantom contour task, as well as reaction time and accuracy in the visual 1-back task. Reading fluency was measured in both single-character and sentence levels. Fluent reading of single characters was assessed with a paper-and-pencil lexical decision task, and a sentence verification task was developed to examine reading fluency on a sentence level. The reading fluency test in each level was conducted twice (i.e., oral reading and silent reading). Reading speed and accuracy were recorded. The correlation analysis showed that the temporal threshold in the phantom contour task did not correlate with the scores of the reading fluency tests. Although, the reaction time in visual 1-back task correlated with the reading speed of both oral and silent reading fluency, the comparison of the correlation coefficients revealed a closer relationship between the visual rapid simultaneous processing and silent reading. Furthermore, the visual rapid simultaneous processing exhibited a significant contribution to reading fluency in silent mode but not in oral reading mode. These findings suggest that the underlying mechanism between oral and silent reading fluency is different at the beginning of the basic visual coding. The current results also might reveal a potential modulation of the language characteristics of Chinese on the relationship between visual rapid processing and reading fluency. © 2017 Zhao, Kwok, Liu, Liu and Huang.",0.4548022598870056

Neural differences between the processing of musical meaning conveyed by direction of pitch change and natural music in congenital amusia,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008625161&doi=10.1016%2fj.neuropsychologia.2016.12.024&partnerID=40&md5=9db7e255ad335a207a1fd450ebffac25,"Music is a unique communication system for human beings. Iconic musical meaning is one dimension of musical meaning, which emerges from musical information resembling sounds of objects, qualities of objects, or qualities of abstract concepts. The present study investigated whether congenital amusia, a disorder of musical pitch perception, impacts the processing of iconic musical meaning. With a cross-modal semantic priming paradigm, target images were primed by semantically congruent or incongruent musical excerpts, which were characterized by direction (upward or downward) of pitch change (Experiment 1), or were selected from natural music (Experiment 2). Twelve Mandarin-speaking amusics and 12 controls performed a recognition (implicit) and a semantic congruency judgment (explicit) task while their EEG waveforms were recorded. Unlike controls, amusics failed to elicit an N400 effect when musical meaning was represented by direction of pitch change, regardless of the nature of the tasks (implicit versus explicit). However, the N400 effect in response to musical meaning in natural musical excerpts was observed for both the groups in both types of tasks. These results indicate that amusics are able to process iconic musical meaning through multiple acoustic cues in natural musical excerpts, but not through the direction of pitch change. This is the first study to investigate the processing of musical meaning in congenital amusia, providing evidence in support of the “melodic contour deafness hypothesis” with regard to iconic musical meaning processing in this disorder. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0.5151515151515151
Human brain activity related to the tactile perception of stickiness,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010868298&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00008&partnerID=40&md5=423a2041cb2117474cf2c576b4a0a00b,"While the perception of stickiness serves as one of the fundamental dimensions for tactile sensation, little has been elucidated about the stickiness sensation and its neural correlates. The present study investigated how the human brain responds to perceived tactile sticky stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To evoke tactile perception of stickiness with multiple intensities, we generated silicone stimuli with varying catalyst ratios. Also, an acrylic sham stimulus was prepared to present a condition with no sticky sensation. From the two psychophysics experiments-the methods of constant stimuli and the magnitude estimation—we could classify the silicone stimuli into two groups according to whether a sticky perception was evoked: the Supra-threshold group that evoked sticky perception and the Infra-threshold group that did not. In the Supra-threshold vs. Sham contrast analysis of the fMRI data using the general linear model (GLM), the contralateral primary somatosensory area (S1) and ipsilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed significant activations in subjects, whereas no significant result was found in the Infra-threshold vs. Sham contrast. This result indicates that the perception of stickiness not only activates the somatosensory cortex, but also possibly induces higher cognitive processes. Also, the Supra- vs. Infra-threshold contrast analysis revealed significant activations in several subcortical regions, including the pallidum, putamen, caudate and thalamus, as well as in another region spanning the insula and temporal cortices. These brain regions, previously known to be related to tactile discrimination, may subserve the discrimination of different intensities of tactile stickiness. The present study unveils the human neural correlates of the tactile perception of stickiness and may contribute to broadening the understanding of neural mechanisms associated with tactile perception. © 2017 Yeon, Kim, Ryu, Park, Chung and Kim.",0.44964028776978415
Database of synesthetic color associations for Japanese kanji,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953404978&doi=10.3758%2fs13428-015-0691-z&partnerID=40&md5=6bb8d9ef8c2ec9e2797361c104d13166,"Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which certain types of stimuli elicit involuntary perceptions in an unrelated pathway. A common type of synesthesia is grapheme–color synesthesia, in which the visual perception of letters and numbers stimulates the perception of a specific color. Previous studies have often collected relatively small numbers of grapheme–color associations per synesthete, but the accumulation of a large quantity of data has greater promise for uncovering the mechanisms underlying synesthetic association. In this study, we therefore collected large samples of data from a total of eight synesthetes. All told, we obtained over 1000 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese kanji characters from each of two synesthetes, over 100 synesthetic colors form each of three synesthetes, and about 80 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese hiragana, Latin letters, and Arabic numerals from each of three synesthetes. We then compiled the data into a database, called the KANJI-Synesthetic Colors Database (K-SCD), which has a total of 5122 colors for 483, 46, and 46 Japanese kanji, hiragana, and katakana characters, respectively, as well as for 26 Latin letters and ten Arabic numerals. In addition to introducing the K-SCD, this article demonstrates the database’s merits by using two examples, in which two new rules for synesthetic association, “shape similarity” and “synesthetic color clustering,” were found. The K-SCD is publicly accessible (www.cv.jinkan.kyoto-u.ac.jp/site/uploads/K-SCD.xlsm) and will be a valuable resource for those who wish to conduct statistical analyses using a rich dataset in order to uncover the rules governing synesthetic association and to understand its mechanisms. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.4
High power distance enhances employees' preference for likable managers: A resource dependency perspective,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011968312&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2016.02066&partnerID=40&md5=2e2f536c39bf541b4cd26a1e83999187,"Is a manager's likability important from an employee's perspective? Research results in this field are scant and inconsistent. The current study explored employees' response to managers' likability and the moderating effect of power distance at both the cultural and individual levels. In study 1, following the countercultural priming experimental paradigm proposed by Van den Bos et al. (2013), 121 college students from China (a high power distance culture) and 99 college students from Denmark (a low power distance culture) were randomly assigned to either a countercultural (experimental) condition or a control condition. All participants were required to complete a manager selection task using the zero-acquaintance paradigm to measure their preference for likable managers. The results confirmed the moderating role of power distance at the cultural level. Study 2 further explored the moderating effect of power distance orientation at the individual level, as well as the boundary condition of the degree of resource dependence from the employee's perspective. One hundred and three Chinese participants with work experience were randomly assigned to either the subordinate perspective (high resource dependence) or the HR department perspective (low resource dependence) condition and completed the same task as in study 1. The results suggested that high power distance-oriented participants demonstrate stronger preference for likable manager candidates than do low power distance-oriented participants. In addition, these findings hold only when employees expect a high resource dependence relation with the manager. Theoretical and practical implications of the research findings and future research directions were discussed. © 2017 Wei, Sun, Liu, Zhou and Xue.",0.5141700404858299
Reassessment of non-monosynaptic excitation from the motor cortex to motoneurons in single motor units of the human biceps brachii,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014033617&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00019&partnerID=40&md5=a678d0ef4881765a9aa359e6ceb7caa2,"Corticospinal excitation is mediated by polysynaptic pathways in several vertebrates, including dexterous monkeys. However, indirect non-monosynaptic excitation has not been clearly observed following transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) or cervicomedullary stimulation (CMS) in humans. The present study evaluated indirect motor pathways in normal human subjects by recording the activities of single motor units (MUs) in the biceps brachii (BB) muscle. The pyramidal tract was stimulated with weak TES, CMS, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) contralateral to the recording side. During tasks involving weak co-contraction of the BB and hand muscles, all stimulation methods activated MUs with short latencies. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) showed that responses with similar durations were induced by TES (1.9 ± 1.4 ms) and CMS (2.0 ± 1.4 ms), and these responses often showed multiple peaks with the PSTH peak having a long duration (65.3% and 44.9%, respectively). Such long-duration excitatory responses with multiple peaks were rarely observed in the finger muscles following TES or in the BB following stimulation of the Ia fibers. The responses obtained with TES were compared in the same 14 BB MUs during the co-contraction and isolated BB contraction tasks. Eleven and three units, respectively, exhibited activation with multiple peaks during the two tasks. In order to determine the dispersion effects on the axon conduction velocities (CVs) and synaptic noise, a simulation study that was comparable to the TES experiments was performed with a biologically plausible neuromuscular model. When the model included the monosynaptic-pyramidal tract, multiple peaks were obtained in about 34.5% of the motoneurons (MNs). The experimental and simulation results indicated the existence of task-dependent disparate inputs from the pyramidal tract to the MNs of the upper limb. These results suggested that intercalated interneurons are present in the spinal cord and that these interneurons might be equivalent to those identified in animal experiments. © 2017 Nakajima, Tazoe, Sakamoto, Endoh, Shibuya, Elias, Mezzarane, Komiyama and Ohki.",0.3687707641196013
Sexual communication and domestication may give rise to the signal complexity necessary for the emergence of language: An indication from songbird studies,2017,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010808950&doi=10.3758%2fs13423-016-1165-8&partnerID=40&md5=323a11220dc6c7be93308776f2777723,"For language to be a vehicle of thought, protolanguage must develop a degree of complexity that allows for the syntactic manipulation of symbol sequences. Thus, before language emerged, a process in which signals became complex must have occurred. Here, we submit a scenario describing the process in which courtship songs gained in complexity during the course of domestication of Bengalese finches. By comparing domesticated Bengalese finches with their wild strain, white-rumped munias, we found that female preferences for complex songs were coupled with domesticated relaxed environments to give rise to song complexity. Furthermore, we found that the outcomes of domestication in Bengalese finches include decreased psychological and physiological stress reactions, decreased aggressiveness, and changed plumage colors. These characteristics are consistent with “domestication syndrome,” originally proposed for mammals but now possibly applicable to birds. Our finding that domestication was a cause of signal complexity might be helpful in considering the process of signal evolution in human language. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.44025157232704404
Estimation of the effects of heavy Asian dust on respiratory function by definition type,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081903764&doi=10.1186%2fs41021-017-0085-9&partnerID=40&md5=eb316f9af049f25cb1e49387622422ba,"Background: The adverse effects of Asian dust (AD) on health have been demonstrated in earlier studies, but there is no standardized definition for heavy-AD. This study aimed to examine which definition of heavy-AD has the most adverse effect on respiratory function. Methods: One-hundred-and-thirty-seven adults with asthma, and 384 school children self-measured their morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). The four definitions of heavy-AD are: (1) the definition provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), (2) daily median AD particle level ≥ 0.07 km−1, obtained through light detection and ranging (LIDAR) (3) hourly AD particle level ≥ 0.1 km−1, and (4) hourly level ≥ 0.07 km−1. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the effects of heavy-AD, by definition type, on daily PEF values. Results: In adults with asthma, as per the JMA's definition, significantly reduced PEF were observed on heavy-AD days (lag 0), lag 0-1, and lag 0-3. In school children, after a heavy-AD event, as defined by the JMA, PEF significantly decreased on lag 0-1, lag 0-2, and lag 0-3. However, as per the other definitions, there was no significant decrease in the PEF in the adults and children. Conclusion: The associations between heavy-AD and respiratory function differed between these definitions. © The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Integration of teaching processes and learning assessment in the prefrontal cortex during a video game teaching-learning task,2017,39,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012009178&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2016.02052&partnerID=40&md5=546b1e2338bf19602e3679ee6e3fc0c8,"Human teaching is a social interaction that supports reciprocal and dynamical feedback between the teacher and the student. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a region of particular interest due to its demonstrated role in social interaction. In the present study, we evaluated the PFC activity simultaneously in two individuals playing the role of a teacher and student in a video game teaching-learning task. For that, we used two wearable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices in order to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive interactions between teachers and students. Fifteen teacher-student pairs in total (N = 30) participated in this study. Each teacher was instructed to teach the video game to their student partner, without speaking. The PFC activity was simultaneously evaluated in both participants using a wearable 16-channel NIRS system during the video game teaching-learning task. Two sessions, each including a triplet of a 30-s teaching-learning task, were performed in order to evaluate changes in PFC activity after advancement of teaching-learning state. Changes in the teachers' left PFC activity between the first and second session positively correlated with those observed in students (r = 0.694, p = 0.004). Moreover, among teachers, multiple regression analysis revealed a correlation between the left PFC activity and the assessment gap between one's own teaching and the student's understanding (β = 0.649, p = 0.009). Activity in the left PFC changed synchronously in both teachers and students after advancement of the teaching-learning state. The left PFC of teachers may be involved in integrating information regarding one's own teaching process and the student's learning state. The present observations indicate that simultaneous recording and analysis of brain activity data during teacher-student interactions may be useful in the field of educational neuroscience. © 2017 Takeuchi, Mori, Suzukamo and Izumi.",0.4172661870503597

Resting-state brain abnormalities in chronic subjective tinnitus: A meta-analysis,2017,67,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010953639&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00022&partnerID=40&md5=c9c5cf8143e4be4496c49d6bea16d731,"Purpose: The neural mechanisms that give rise to the phantom sound of tinnitus have not been fully elucidated. Neuroimaging studies have revealed abnormalities in resting-state activity that could represent the neural signature of tinnitus, but there is considerable heterogeneity in the data. To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of published neuroimaging studies aimed at identifying a common core of resting-state brain abnormalities in tinnitus patients. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for whole-brain resting-state neuroimaging studies with SPECT, PET and functional MRI that compared chronic tinnitus patients with healthy controls. The authors searched PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge and Embase databases for neuroimaging studies on tinnitus published up to September 2016. From each study, coordinates were extracted from clusters with significant differences between tinnitus subjects and controls. Meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method. Results: Data were included from nine resting-state neuroimaging studies that reported a total of 51 distinct foci. The meta-analysis identified consistent regions of increased resting-state brain activity in tinnitus patients relative to controls that included, bilaterally, the insula, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum posterior lobe and right superior frontal gyrus. Moreover, decreased brain activity was only observed in the left cuneus and right thalamus. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate a characteristic pattern of resting-state brain abnormalities that may serve as neuroimaging markers and contribute to the understanding of neuropathophysiological mechanisms for chronic tinnitus. © 2017 Chen, Wang, Wang, Bo, Xia, Gu and Yin.",0.39285714285714285

Participants were 114 Slovene and 144 Italian adolescents (aged 14 to 18 years old) living in the North-East of Italy. They filled in standardized measures on ethnic, national, familial and religious identity, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Positive Affective Schedule. results Path models showed that stronger collective identity was related to higher scores of perceived psychological wellbeing. Interestingly, for the Slovene minority youth, ethnic Slovenian identity was unrelated to collective identity. Overall, among all youth, all identity components loaded into a single factor of collective identity, confirming previous studies with bicultural minority youth. conclusions The findings shed light on the path linking multiple aspects of collective identities together to adolescents' well-being and are useful in pragmatic terms for improving and facilitating assets of individual and social/collective well-being and functioning of youth. © 2017 Current Issues in Personality Psychology.",0.47417840375586856

Relations between these variables and psychological well-being also were examined. Perceived parent and teacher autonomy support and responsiveness and democratic climate differentially predicted attitudes toward each type of right and were positively correlated with adolescents’ psychological well-being.

The questions answered were, in the course of decomposing and composing Japanese trimorphemic compounds, (1) whether recognition processes are tuned for a specific branching direction, (2) whether the morphological processing proceeds in a bottom-up combinatorial manner, and (3) whether the three constituents of trimorphemic compounds are equally important and processed serially. Mixed-effects regression analyses of response times and fixation durations revealed that a left-branching advantage appears in a late time frame and that, although there was early processing of the whole compound from the first fixation, a character frequency effect was also observed. Furthermore, the first and the third, but not the second, constituent frequencies contributed to compound recognition. This bathtub-like effect was further supported by corpus-based evidence: the conditional probability for the second constituent is incomparably high. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.4266666666666667
Bindings in working memory: The role of object-based attention,2017,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85001819669&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-016-1227-z&partnerID=40&md5=f12025bb4b727a632a44d3eb4ea212d7,"Over the past decade, it has been debated whether retaining bindings in working memory (WM) requires more attention than retaining constituent features, focusing on domain-general attention and space-based attention. Recently, we proposed that retaining bindings in WM needs more object-based attention than retaining constituent features (Shen, Huang, & Gao, 2015, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, doi:10.1037/xhp0000018). However, only unitized visual bindings were examined; to establish the role of object-based attention in retaining bindings in WM, more emperical evidence is required. We tested 4 new bindings that had been suggested requiring no more attention than the constituent features in the WM maintenance phase: The two constituent features of binding were stored in different WM modules (cross-module binding, Experiment 1), from auditory and visual modalities (cross-modal binding, Experiment 2), or temporally (cross-time binding, Experiments 3) or spatially (cross-space binding, Experiments 4–6) separated. In the critical condition, we added a secondary object feature-report task during the delay interval of the change-detection task, such that the secondary task competed for object-based attention with the to-be-memorized stimuli. If more object-based attention is required for retaining bindings than for retaining constituent features, the secondary task should impair the binding performance to a larger degree relative to the performance of constituent features. Indeed, Experiments 1–6 consistently revealed a significantly larger impairment for bindings than for the constituent features, suggesting that object-based attention plays a pivotal role in retaining bindings in WM. © 2016, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.5278969957081545
Evaluation of attitudes to integration of mental health service in the chinese population of nonpsychiatric health-care providers,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149902843&doi=10.4103%2fhm.hm_3_17&partnerID=40&md5=4f8c2fa3bea02e063d28cfe3290904e3,"Objectives: The objective of this study was designed to assess the attitudes of Chinese nonpsychiatric health-care providers in Guangdong to mental health services (MHSs) integrated into the system of health care. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the attitudes of nonpsychiartric health-care providers to integrated MHS in 16 tertiary general hospitals from December 2012 to March 2013. A multiple regression model was used to analyze the impact factors of the subjects' attitudes to integrated MHS. Results: Of all the 2574 subjects, 1842 (71.6%) subjects strongly supported integrated MHS in general hospitals while only 4.3% (111) of subjects disagreed/strongly disagreed with integrated MHS. The rest of subjects (621/24.1%) remained neutral. The multiple regression model analyses presented that those male subjects with postgraduate diplomas who agreed with integrated MHS were interested in training on MHS. Approximately, more than 30% of subjects who were diagnosed with mental disorders and worked for 8-10 h/day were prone to obtain MHS and own a positive attitude to MHS in clinical practice. Conclusions: Most subjects owned positive attitudes to MHS in clinical practice. Lack of MHS knowledge is the major obstacle to those subjects who disagreed with integrated MHS.  © 2017 Heart and Mind | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",0.4083769633507853
The sense of self and other in nonverbal communication: A study using video analysis of dialog scenes,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074994604&doi=10.2117%2fpsysoc.2019-B004&partnerID=40&md5=79bbe3198adff4273c4bba12229d90bb,"This research attempted to empirically investigate how individuals experience ""self"" and ""others"" according to the theory of sense of self from nonverbal aspects. In the survey, participants (N = 15) read a short story and discussed it with the researcher. All dialogs were video recorded and nonverbal behaviors of participants/the researcher in the obtained video data were coded based on analysis index. Quantified nonverbal behaviors were analyzed using moving correlation method, and time series changes of nonverbal behavioral synchronization between participants and the researcher were examined. Results revealed that in those with a high sense of self, active mutual exchange was maintained between self and others in the non-linguistic domain. Conversely, in those with a low sense of self, mutuality in the nonverbal area was weak. This result suggests the importance of nonverbal areas in considering the problems in sense of self of adults. © 2017 Psychologia Society. All rights reserved.",0.4013605442176871

The aim of the present study was to investigate epistasis interactions between MAOA-variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), 5-HTTlinked polymorphism (LPR) and child abuse and the effects of these on aggressive tendencies in a group of otherwise healthy adolescents. A group of 546 Chinese male adolescents completed the Child Trauma Questionnaire and Youth self-report of the Child Behavior Checklist. Buccal cells were collected for DNA analysis. The effects of childhood abuse, MAOA-VNTR, 5-HTTLPR genotypes and their interactive gene-gene-environmental effects on aggressive behavior were analyzed using a linear regression model. The effect of child maltreatment was significant, and a three-way interaction among MAOA-VNTR, 5-HTTLPR and sexual abuse (SA) relating to aggressive behaviors was identified. Chinese male adolescents with high expression of the MAOA-VNTR allele and 5-HTTLPR “SS” genotype exhibited the highest aggression tendencies with an increase in SA during childhood. The findings reported support aggression being a complex behavior involving the synergistic effects of gene-gene-environment interactions. © 2017 Zhang, Ming, Yi, Wang, Chai and Yao.",0.34615384615384615
Individual differences in spontaneous expressive suppression predict amygdala responses to fearful stimuli: The role of suppression priming,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012108006&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00001&partnerID=40&md5=74d2ec0755a7e81b764db2cd83fd26b2,"Though the spontaneous emotion regulation has received long discussions, few studies have explored the regulatory effects of spontaneous expressive suppression in neural activations, especially in collectivistic cultural context. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed to examine whether individual differences in the tendency to use suppression are correlated with amygdala responses to negative situations when individuals are unconsciously primed with expressive suppression. Twenty-three healthy Chinese undergraduates completed an fMRI paradigm involving fear processing, and a synonym matching task was added to prime participants with the unconscious (automatic) expressive suppression goal. Participants completed measures of typical emotion regulation use (reappraisal and suppression), trait anxiety, and neuroticism. Results indicated that only in emotion suppression prime condition, greater use of suppression in everyday life was related to decreased amygdala activity. These associations were not attributable to variation in trait anxiety, neuroticism, or the habitual use of reappraisal. These findings suggest that in collectivistic cultural settings, individual differences in expressive suppression do not alter fear-related neural activation during suppression-irrelevant context. However, unconscious suppression priming facilitates the manifestation of individual differences in the neural consequence of expressive suppression, as reflected by the priming-specific decrease of emotional subcortical activations with more use of expressive suppression. © 2017 Chen, Deng, Xu, Long, Yang and Yuan.",0.5217391304347826
Influence of simple action on subsequent manual and ocular responses,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010739425&doi=10.3758%2fs13414-017-1280-2&partnerID=40&md5=964eafb73a0d0e5437bba6ecb734d26e,"Recent investigations into how action affects perception have revealed an interesting “action effect”—that is, simply acting upon an object enhances its processing in subsequent tasks. The previous studies, however, relied only on manual responses, allowing an alternative stimulus-response binding account of the effect. The current study examined whether the action effect occurs in the presence of changes in response modalities. In Experiment 1, participants completed a modified action effect paradigm, in which they first produced an arbitrary manual response to a shape and then performed a visual search task in which the previous shape was either a valid or invalid cue—responding with a manual or saccadic response. In line with previous studies, the visual search was faster when the shape was a valid cue but only if the shape had been acted upon. Critically, this action effect emerged similarly in both the manual and ocular response conditions. This cross-modality action effect was successfully replicated in Experiment 2, and analysis of eye movement trajectories further revealed similar action effect patterns on direction and numerosity. These results rule out the stimulus-response binding account of the action effect and suggest that it indeed occurs at an attentional level. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0.5076142131979695
Anxious individuals are impulsive decision-makers in the delay discounting task: An ERP study,2017,63,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010903682&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2017.00005&partnerID=40&md5=2ffcf542cb40cc43753869c883cb760c,"Impulsivity, which is linked to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, is often characterized by a preference for immediate but smaller rewards over delayed but larger rewards. However, debate exists on the relationship between anxiety and impulsivity. Here we use event-related potential (ERP) components as biomarkers in the temporal discounting task to examine the effect of anxiety on inter-temporal decision-making. Our behavioral results indicated that the high trait anxiety (HTA) group made significantly more immediate choices than the low trait anxiety (LTA) group. Compared with the LTA group, shorter response time was associated with immediate rewards in the HTA group. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated three ERP components that are associated with impulsivity and/or delay discounting. First, the N1 is an early sensory component involved in selective attention and attention processing for goal-directed actions. Second, the reward positivity (RewP) reflects reward-related dopaminergic activity and encodes reward values. Third, the P3 is regarded as a measure of motivational significance in the decision-making literature. Accordingly, this study found in the immediate-option-evoked ERPs that the HTA group had a larger N1 than the LTA group did. For the delayed-option-evoked ERPs, the HTA group had larger N1 and RewP for the immediate choice than the LTA group did, while the LTA group had a larger P3 for the delayed choice than the HTA group did. These results support the notion that anxiety individuals are impulsive decision-makers in the Delay Discounting Task. © 2017 Fung, Crone.",0.4602510460251046

Observing third-party attentional relationships affects infants' gaze following: An eye-tracking study,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011982637&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2016.02065&partnerID=40&md5=d2d5341ff174b4ec6dde9e644ad3726c,"Not only responding to direct social actions toward themselves, infants also pay attention to relevant information from third-party interactions. However, it is unclear whether and how infants recognize the structure of these interactions. The current study aimed to investigate how infants' observation of third-party attentional relationships influence their subsequent gaze following. Nine-month-old, 1-year-old, and 1.5-year-old infants (N = 72, 37 girls) observed video clips in which a female actor gazed at one of two toys after she and her partner either silently faced each other (face-to-face condition) or looked in opposite directions (back-to-back condition). An eye tracker was used to record the infants' looking behavior (e.g., looking time, looking frequency). The analyses revealed that younger infants followed the actor's gaze toward the target object in both conditions, but this was not the case for the 1.5-year-old infants in the back-to-back condition. Furthermore, we found that infants' gaze following could be negatively predicted by their expectation of the partner's response to the actor's head turn (i.e., they shift their gaze toward the partner immediately after they realize that the actor's head will turn). These findings suggested that the sensitivity to the difference in knowledge and attentional states in the second year of human life could be extended to third-party interactions, even without any direct involvement in the situation. Additionally, a spontaneous concern with the epistemic gap between self and other, as well as between others, develops by this age. These processes might be considered part of the fundamental basis for human communication. © 2017 Meng, Uto and Hashiya.",0.4126984126984127

We present three studies in support of a novel prediction that sociocultural change in China plays an important role in augmenting self-enhancement. We operationalized self-enhancement primarily in terms of the better-than-average effect (BTAE) and accounted for trait desirability or importance. We found that: (i) compared with Chinese Canadians, Chinese showed a stronger BTAE; (ii) within the Chinese, identification with contemporary Chinese culture uniquely predicted a stronger BTAE; and (iii) priming contemporary (vs. traditional) Chinese culture led to a stronger BTAE. Finally, we provided further evidence that motivation, in part, underlies the rising Chinese BTAE. We conclude by discussing the importance of both socioeconomic and cultural perspectives for understanding how and when of self-enhancement in contemporary China and other societies undergoing social change.

Opportunity cost is defined as the cost of a benefit that must be forgone in order to pursue a better alternative (Becker et al., 1974). In both studies, participants read about hypothetical purchase scenarios, and then decided whether they would buy a certain product. Opportunity cost consideration was measured in two ways: (1) participants' thoughts pertaining to other (nonfocal) products while making decisions; (2) participants' decisions not to buy a focal product (Study 1) or a more expensive product (Study 2). Across both indexes, we found that after controlling for individual difference variables and amount of pocket money, Chinese participants in China considered financial opportunity cost more than Euro-Canadians in Study 1.

Prefrontal function engaging in external-focused attention in 5- to 6-month-old infants: A suggestion for default mode network,2017,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010901148&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2016.00676&partnerID=40&md5=cff6179a0ea3f07a985b233460e4062e,"The present study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure 5- to 6-month-old infants’ hemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to visual stimuli differing in saliency and social value. Nineteen Japanese 5- to 6-month-old infants watched video clips of Peek-a-Boo (social signal) performed by an anime character (AC) or a human, and hand movements without social signal performed by an AC. The PFC activity of infants was measured by 22-channel fNIRS, while behaviors including looking time were recorded simultaneously. NIRS data showed that infants’ hemodynamic responses in the PFC generally decreased due to these stimuli, and the decrease was most prominent in the frontopolar (FP), covering medial PFC (MPFC), when infants were viewing Peek-a-Boo performed by an AC. Moreover, the decrease was more pronounced in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) when infants were viewing Peek-a-Boo performed by an AC than by a human. Accordingly, behavioral data revealed significantly longer looking times when Peek-a-Boo was performed by an AC than by a human. No significant difference between Peek-a-Boo and non- Peek-a-Boo conditions was observed in either measure. These findings indicate that infants at this age may prefer stimuli with more salient features, which may be more effective in attracting their attentions. In conjunction with our previous findings on responses to self-name calling in infants of similar age, we hypothesize that the dynamic function of the MPFC and its vicinity (as part of default mode network (DMN): enhanced by self-focused stimuli, attenuated by externally focused stimuli), which is consistently observed in adults, may have already emerged in 5- to 6-month-old infants. © 2017 Xu, Hoshino, Yatabe, Matsuda, Sato, Maki, Yoshimura and Minagawa.",0.41509433962264153

The study also attempts to explore the neural substrates underlying the cognitive effect of BMB intervention using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique. Forty-two healthy college students were randomly allocated into either the Baduanjin intervention group or relaxation training (control) group. Training lasted for 8 weeks (90 min/day, 5 days/week). Each participant was administered the shortened Profile of Mood States to evaluate their mood status and the flanker task to evaluate executive function before and after training. While performing the flanker task, the NIRS data were collected from each participant. After training, individuals who have participated in BMB exercise showed a significant reduction in depressive mood compared with the same measure before the intervention. However, participants in the control group showed no such reduction. The before vs. after measurement difference in the flanker task incongruent trails was significant only for the Baduanjin intervention group. Interestingly, an increase in oxygenated hemoglobin in the left prefrontal cortex was observed during the Incongruent Trails test only after the BMB exercise intervention. These findings implicate that Baduanjin is an effective and easy-to-administering mind-body exercise for improving executive function and perhaps brain self-regulation in a young and healthy population. © 2017 Chen, Yue, Tian and Jiang.",0.41284403669724773

The apathy and frailty are risk factors in the disease progresses. However, there is currently no effective drug for treating both anorexia and apathy in AD. Here, we conducted an open-label pilot study to determine whether ninjin'yoeito (NYT, TJ-108), a multicomponent drug, is effective for improving anorexia and apathy in patients with AD, and consequently their cognitive function. Trials were conducted at three sites in Japan. Twenty patients [4 men and 16 women, average age 82.6±7.7 (mean±SD) years old], including 19 AD and 1 mixed dementia with anorexia/apathy, were examined. NYT (69 g/day) was administered for 12 weeks. The changes in scores for ""anorexia"" using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) subcategory for eating disturbance (primary outcome measure), NPI including ""apathy"", the vitality index, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and physical and blood nutrition indices were evaluated at baseline (week 0), and weeks 4, 8 and 12. After week 4, significant improvements were observed in the scores for ""anorexia"" and ""apathy"" by NPI and meal ingestion amount. Vitality index and MMSE score were significantly improved by week 12. We propose that NYT, a multicomponent drug with several effects including dopamine modulation, is a new-type dementia therapeutic agent with low risk of adverse reactions that can improve simultaneously anorexia/apathy, as well as cognitive dysfunction in frail AD patients. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

The PSG represents a situation in which both the motivations of spite and of fear can logically drive players to choose an option of aggression against an opponent. Participants decide whether or not to attack another participant, who also has the same capability. The decision is made in real time, using a computer. We discuss theoretical implications of our findings on the evolutionary foundations of intragroup cooperation and intergroup aggression. The evolutionary model of intergroup aggression, or the parochial altruism model, posits that intragroup cooperation and intergroup aggression have co-evolved, and thus it predicts both intragroup cooperation and intergroup aggression to emerge even in a minimal group devoid of a history of intergroup relationships. The finding that only intragroup cooperation but not intergroup aggression emerged in the minimal group experiments strongly suggests that intergroup aggression involves a psychological mechanism that is independent from that of intragroup cooperation. We further discuss the implications of these findings on real-world politics and military strategy. © 2017 Mifune, Simunovic and Yamagishi.",0.4049586776859504

Barriers and enablers are properties, situations, or conditions in the product development process, team, or context that negatively or positively influence the usability of a product. Based on a review of literature on user-centered design and exploratory expert interview, central concepts for studying usability in practice were identified. This was used as input for the case study, which was conducted at 5 product development groups in large multinationals, making (a) portable audio/video players, (b) personal navigation devices, (c) cell phones, (d) laundry care products, and (e) home control products. Data were primarily collected through interviews with 31 product development practitioners. Based on the data collected, case descriptions were created and more than 1,500 barriers and enablers were identified, categorized, and analyzed. The results of the study are 23 sets of barriers and enablers, of which it is indicated in which of the cases they occur, and accompanied with illustrative quotations from the interviewees. In barriers and enablers, a predominantly “outside–in” relation was observed, from the more external properties of companies (market, company organization) to the more internal (process, team, project). This seems to indicate that the user-centeredness of a product development process is highly influenced by the context in which it is executed. The results also lead to the conclusion that if the goal is to make usable products, one cannot only address activities that are generally considered typical of user-centered design, such as conducting user research and user testing. One also has to take into account how these activities are integrated with and supported by the rest of the product development process, which in turn has to be supported by the product development organization.

The main effects of dilemma type, frame, and number of saved workers were all significant. The interaction of dilemma type and number of saved workers and the interaction of the three independent factors were significant. Results indicated that moral judgment is affected by framing. Specifically, people were more inclined to utilitarianism in the positive or neutral frame and more inclined to intuitionism in the negative frame.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether tolerable pain influences gastric fundal accommodation and gastric motility in healthy subjects. Methods: We undertook a crossover comparison study to evaluate gastric fundal accommodation and gastric motility in 74 healthy subjects in the presence or absence of tolerable pain. The intensity of tolerable pain was defined as the upper limit of pain compatible with comfortable daily life. Pain was generated by clipping a clothes pin to the ear lobe, and the intensity of pain was adjusted by inserting the gauze between the ear lobe and the pin. Gastric fundal accommodation and gastric motility were assessed by external ultrasonography. The cross-sectional area of the proximal stomach was measured after subjects had taken 100mL-liquid meals four times, then the amplitude and frequency of antral contractions were measured. Results: The median numerical rating scale of tolerable pain was 3 (interquartile rang 2-4). Gastric fundal accommodation, gastric motility and gastric emptying were all significantly impaired by tolerable pain (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusions: Even tolerable pain can reduce gastric fundal accommodation and gastric motility, which could result in anorexia or decreased quality of life.

Suboptimal decision making by children with ADHD in the face of risk: Poor risk adjustment and delay aversion rather than general proneness to taking risks,2017,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85001029973&doi=10.1037%2fneu0000297&partnerID=40&md5=0bc0cf351c5aaea4471aa797a4f2a640,"Objective: Suboptimal decision making in the face of risk (DMR) in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be mediated by deficits in a number of different neuropsychological processes. We investigated DMR in children with ADHD using the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) to distinguish difficulties in adjusting to changing probabilities of choice outcomes (so-called risk adjustment) from general risk proneness, and to distinguish these 2 processes from delay aversion (the tendency to choose the least delayed option) and impairments in the ability to reflect on choice options. Based on previous research, we predicted that suboptimal performance on this task in children with ADHD would be primarily relate to problems with risk adjustment and delay aversion rather than general risk proneness. Method: Drug naïve children with ADHD (n = 36), 8 to 12 years, and an age-matched group of typically developing children (n = 34) performed the CGT. Results: As predicted, children with ADHD were not more prone to making risky choices (i.e., risk proneness). However, they had difficulty adjusting to changing risk levels and were more delay aversive-with these 2 effects being correlated. Conclusions: Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that children with ADHD do not favor risk taking per se when performing gambling tasks, but rather may lack the cognitive skills or motivational style to appraise changing patterns of risk effectively. © 2016 American Psychological Association.",0.4318181818181818
The involvement of the dorsal stream in processing implied actions between paired objects: A TMS study,2017,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007523814&doi=10.1016%2fj.neuropsychologia.2016.12.021&partnerID=40&md5=421577e8f1cb7b33bfecbaed73fefc30,"Perceiving and selecting the action possibilities (affordances) provided by objects is an important challenge to human vision, and is not limited to single-object scenarios. Xu et al. (2015) identified two effects of implied actions between paired objects on response selection: an inhibitory effect on responses aligned with the passive object in the pair (e.g. a bowl) and an advantage associated with responses aligned with the active objects (e.g. a spoon). The present study investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms behind these effects by examining the involvement of the ventral (vision for perception) and the dorsal (vision for action) visual streams, as defined in Goodale and Milner's (1992) two visual stream theory. Online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) reduced both the inhibitory effect of implied actions on responses aligned with the passive objects and the advantage of those aligned with the active objects, but only when the active objects were contralateral to the stimulation. rTMS to the left lateral occipital areas (LO) did not significantly alter the influence of implied actions. The results reveal that the dorsal visual stream is crucial not only in single-object affordance processing, but also in responding to implied actions between objects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0.48258706467661694

Moral and sexual disgust suppress sexual risk behaviors among men who have sex with men in China,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012008523&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2016.02045&partnerID=40&md5=31daddc9fdd184829fd67ff2d693a363,"Increasingly more men who have sex with men (MSM) are engaging in sexual risk taking in China in recent years. Given the high rates of HIV infection among MSM in China, it is urgent that we understand the factors that influence MSM's practice of sexual risk taking. Disgust sensitivity, which elicits a behavioral avoidance response, has the potential to influence risky sexual behavior. The present study examined the relationship between disgust sensitivity and sexual risk behavior among MSM in China. Men (n = 584) who reported having anal intercourse in the previous 6 months were recruited from the Internet. Two indicators of sexual risk behaviors were measured: condom use and the number of sex partners. The results indicated that moral disgust was positively associated with condom use, with MSM who had higher moral disgust being more likely to use condoms than others did. Sexual disgust was positively associated with the number of sex partners, with MSM who had higher sexual disgust having fewer male sex partners than others did. Sexual and moral disgust sensitivity significantly predicted HIV testing. Our study verified that sexual and moral disgust suppressed sexual risk behaviors and promoted HIV testing. Moral and sexual education should be incorporated in future strategies for HIV prevention and encouragement of safe sex behaviors among MSM in China. © 2017 Zhang, Zheng and Zheng.",0.45871559633027525
Development of visual working memory and distractor resistance in relation to academic performance,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010188967&doi=10.1016%2fj.jecp.2016.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=abe446668b899fb9c8d78caf99f5f2a9,"Visual working memory (VWM) enables active maintenance of goal-relevant visual information in a readily accessible state. The storage capacity of VWM is severely limited, often as few as 3 simple items. Thus, it is crucial to restrict distractor information from consuming VWM capacity. The current study investigated how VWM storage and distractor resistance develop during childhood in relation to academic performance in the classroom. Elementary school children (7- to 12-year-olds) and adults (total N = 140) completed a VWM task with and without visual/verbal distractors during the retention period. The results showed that VWM performance with and without distractors developed at similar rates until reaching adult levels at 10 years of age. In addition, higher VWM performance without distractors was associated with higher academic scores in literacy (reading and writing), mathematics, and science for the younger children (7- to 9-year-olds), whereas these academic scores for the older children (10- to 12-year-olds) were associated with VWM performance with visual distractors. Taken together, these results suggest that VWM storage and distractor resistance develop at a similar rate, whereas their contributions to academic performance differ with age. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.44692737430167595
STIM2 regulates AMPA receptor trafficking and plasticity at hippocampal synapses,2017,23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994364990&doi=10.1016%2fj.nlm.2016.08.007&partnerID=40&md5=d32a24c4fb4f184659ccb49c07e7e38f,"STIM2 is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that regulates the activity of plasma membrane (PM) channels at ER-PM contact sites. Recent studies show that STIM2 promotes spine maturation and surface expression of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1, hinting at a probable role in synaptic plasticity. Here, we used a Stim2 cKO mouse to explore the function of STIM2 in Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and Depression (LTD), two widely-studied models of synaptic plasticity implicated in information storage. We found that STIM2 is required for the stable expression of both LTP and LTD at CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses. Altered plasticity in Stim2 cKO mice is associated with subtle alterations in the shape and density of dendritic spines in CA1 neurons. Further, surface delivery of GluA1 in response to LTP-inducing chemical manipulations was markedly reduced in excitatory neurons derived from Stim2 cKO mice. GluA1 endocytosis following chemically-induced LTD was also impaired in Stim2 cKO neurons. We conclude that STIM2 facilitates synaptic delivery and removal of AMPARs and regulates activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength through a unique mode of communication between the ER and the synapse. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.35294117647058826
The interactive influence of perceived ownership and perceived choosership of stocks on brain response to stock outcomes,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012054586&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00008&partnerID=40&md5=4f2f0875e597fcf187c3f5289fb5e432,"The present research examined the influence of perceived ownership (self/other) and perceived chooser (self/other) of stocks on brain activity, and investigated whether differential brain responses to stock outcomes as a result of perceived differences in ownership of stock would be modulated by perceived chooser of stock. We used a 2 (stock chooser: self, other) × 2 (stock owner: self, other) within-subject design to represent four types of chooser-owner relationships. Brain potentials were recorded while participants observed increasing and decreasing stock prices. Results showed that observations of stock outcomes among four types of chooser-owner relationships elicited differentiated feedback-related negativity (d-FRN: differences in FRN waves between losses and gains, reflecting violations of expectancy to stock outcomes): (1) Self-chosen-other-owned stocks evoked significantly larger d-FRN discrepancies than self-chosen-self-owned stocks, indicating a greater expectancy violation to others' losses than to one's own, demonstrating a reversed ownership effect. Moreover, people high in conscientiousness showed an increase in this trend, suggesting a stronger other-consideration; (2) Self-chosen-self-owned stocks and other-chosen-self-owned stocks revealed no significant d-FRN discrepancy, showing no choosership effect beyond the ownership effect; (3) Other-chosen-self-owned stocks evoked a significantly stronger d-FRN discrepancy than other-chosen-other-owned stocks, demonstrating an ownership effect; (4) Self-chosen-other-owned stocks evoked a significantly stronger d-FRN discrepancy than other-chosen-other-owned stocks, revealing a choosership effect. These findings suggest that the ownership effect could be reversed by conscientiousness induced by perceived choosership in the agency relationship, while the choosership effect is attenuated and even disappears under the influence of perceived ownership. © 2017 Shang, Wang and Wu.",0.39166666666666666
The impact of perceptual/concurrent and mnemonic digits on temporal processing: A congruency effect of numerical magnitudes,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012014098&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2016.02014&partnerID=40&md5=923f1f636b131059668af7982b9a20d1,"Task-irrelevant stimulus numbers can automatically modulate concurrent temporal tasks--leading to the phenomenon of number-time association (NTA). Recent research provides converging evidence that the NTA occurs at the stage of temporal memory. Specifically, a reference memory containing encoded duration information can be modified by perceptual/concurrent digits, i.e., a perceptual/concurrent digit-induced NTA. Here, with five experiments, we investigated whether another working memory (WM)-related mechanism was involved in the generation of NTAs and how this memory-induced NTA was related with the perception-induced NTA. We first explored whether similar NTA effects existed for mnemonic digits which disappeared before time encoding but were actively maintained in WM, i.e., a mnemonic digit-induced NTA. Experiments 1-3 demonstrated both types of NTAs. Further, we revealed a close relationship between the two types of NTAs in two contexts. First, the mnemonic digit-induced NTA also relied on a perceptual number-time co-occurrence at time encoding. We found that the mnemonic digits influenced subsequent temporal processing when a task-irrelevant constant number '5' was presented during target encoding, but not when a non-numerical symbol was presented, suggesting that temporal representations in the reference memory could be accessed and modified by both sensory and postsensory numerical magnitudes through this number-time co-occurrence. Second, the effects of perceptual and mnemonic digits on temporal reproduction could cancel each other out. A congruency effect for perceptual and mnemonic digits (relying on memorization requirement) was demonstrated in Experiments 4 and 5. Specifically, a typical NTA was observed when the magnitudes of memorized and the perceptual/concurrent digits were congruent (both were large or small numbers), but not when they were incongruent (one small and one large numbers). Taken together, our study sheds new light on the mechanism of NTA. © 2017 Fan, Jing, Ding and Cheng.",0.43214285714285716

Hence, the aim of this study was to determine whether adolescents with CD exhibit atypical affective and cognitive neural empathic responses during pain-related empathy processing. Methods: A total of 30 adolescents with a CD diagnosis and 36 without CD symptoms were recruited from out-patient clinics and local middle schools in the same region, respectively. All 66 participants were subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing video clips depicting a face with a neutral expression receiving non-painful stimulation (Q-tip touch) or a face with a painful expression receiving painful stimulation (needle penetration) applied to the left or right cheek. Results: The regions associated with affective and cognitive empathy were activated in the HC group during pain-related empathy processing. Compared to HCs, adolescents with CD showed significantly reduced activation in the bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Conclusions: Adolescents with CD exhibited dampened hemodynamic responses during pain-related empathy processing in the bilateral TPJ, a region associated with cognitive empathy. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adolescents with CD may have a cognitive empathy deficiency. © 2017 Dong, Ming, Wang, Yu, Jiang, Wu, Gao and Yao.",0.32338308457711445

Five hundred and twelve students from two universities in China participated in the study. The participants completed questionnaires in class concerning the extent to which they perceived their learning environment to be constructivist-oriented and their subjective well-being (i.e., life satisfaction and positive and negative affect). After controlling for demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, university, and major), students' perceptions of a constructivist learning environment were significantly linked to their life satisfaction and positive and negative affect. More specifically, the environmental dimensions of clear goals and coherence of curricula, student-student cooperation, and learning facilities were positively associated with life satisfaction, and clear goals and coherence of curricula and learning facilities were also positively related to positive affect. However, student autonomy was found to be negatively related to life satisfaction. Despite that these results are correlational in nature, implications for higher education are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0.5123456790123457
Impaired memory for instructions in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is improved by action at presentation and recall,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012054064&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00039&partnerID=40&md5=3db6637fa539dcbc43a88d9f6b6dc6f1,"Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often fail to comply with teacher instructions in the classroom. Using action during presentation or recall can enhance typically developing children's abilities to complete multi-step instruction sequences. In this study, we tested the ability to following instructions in children with ADHD under different conditions to explore whether they show the same beneficial effects of action. A total of 24 children with ADHD and 27 typically developing children either listened to or viewed demonstrations of instructions during encoding, and then either verbally repeated or physically performed the sequences during recall. This resulted in four conditions: spoken-verbal, spoken-enacted, demonstration-verbal, and demonstration-enacted. Children with ADHD were significantly impaired in all conditions of the following instructions task relative to the typically developing group. Both groups showed an enacted-recall advantage, with superior recall by physical performance than oral repetition. Both groups also benefitted from demonstration over spoken presentation, but only when the instructions were recalled verbally. These findings suggest that children with ADHD struggle to complete multi-step instructions, but that they benefit from action-based presentation and recall in the same way as typically developing children. These findings have important implications for educators, suggesting that motor-based methods of instruction-delivery might enhance classroom learning both for children with and without developmental disorders. © 2017 Yang, Allen, Holmes and Chan.",0.4418604651162791

In the dynamic interaction of a driver-vehicle-environment system, risk perception of drivers changes dynamically. In this study, we focused on drivers’ risk perception at unsignalized intersections in China and analyzed their crossing behavior with consideration of risk perception. Based on cognitive psychology theory and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, quantitative models of drivers’ risk perception were established for the crossing processes between two straight-moving vehicles from the orthogonal direction. Drivers’ acceptable risk perception levels were identified using a self-developed data analysis method. On the basis of game theory, the relationship among the quantitative value of drivers’ risk perception, acceptable risk perception level, and vehicle motion state was analyzed, then the crossing behavior models of drivers were established. Finally, the behavior models were validated using data collected from real-world vehicle movements and driver decisions. The results showed that the developed behavior models had both high accuracy and good applicability. This study would provide theoretical and algorithmic references for the microscopic simulation and active safety control system of vehicles. © 2016",0.5027027027027027

Modeling the time-course of responses for the border ownership selectivity based on the integration of feedforward signals and visual cortical interactions,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012009188&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2016.02084&partnerID=40&md5=06f55e6709568baea08f7f9207d50c5c,"Border ownership (BO) indicates which side of a contour owns a border, and it plays a fundamental role in figure-ground segregation. The majority of neurons in V2 and V4 areas of monkeys exhibit BO selectivity. A physiological work reported that the responses of BO-selective cells show a rapid transition when a presented square is flipped along its classical receptive field (CRF) so that the opposite BO is presented, whereas the transition is significantly slower when a square with a clear BO is replaced by an ambiguous edge, e.g., when the square is enlarged greatly. The rapid transition seemed to reflect the influence of feedforward processing on BO selectivity. Herein, we investigated the role of feedforward signals and cortical interactions for time-courses in BO-selective cells by modeling a visual cortical network comprising V1, V2, and posterior parietal (PP) modules. In our computational model, the recurrent pathways among these modules gradually established the visual progress and the BO assignments. Feedforward inputs mainly determined the activities of these modules. Surrounding suppression/facilitation of early-level areas modulates the activities of V2 cells to provide BO signals. Weak feedback signals from the PP module enhanced the contrast gain extracted in V1, which underlies the attentional modulation of BO signals. Model simulations exhibited time-courses depending on the BO ambiguity, which were caused by the integration delay of V1 and V2 cells and the local inhibition therein given the difference in input stimulus. However, our model did not fully explain the characteristics of crucially slow transition: the responses of BO-selective physiological cells indicated the persistent activation several times longer than that of our model after the replacement with the ambiguous edge. Furthermore, the time-course of BO-selective model cells replicated the attentional modulation of response time in human psychophysical experiments. These attentional modulations for time-courses were induced by selective enhancement of early-level features due to interactions between V1 and PP. Our proposed model suggests fundamental roles of surrounding suppression/facilitation based on feedforward inputs as well as the interactions between early and parietal visual areas with respect to the ambiguity dependence of the neural dynamics in intermediate-level vision. © 2017 Wagatsuma and Sakai.",0.42735042735042733

The purpose of this study was to examine how patient and caregiver characteristics are associated with advance directive (AD) completion among patients diagnosed with a terminal illness. We defined AD completion as having completed a living will and/or identified a healthcare power of attorney. Method: A convenience sample of 206 caregiver-patient dyads was included in the study. All patients were diagnosed with an advanced life-limiting illness. Trained research nurses administered surveys to collect information on patient and caregiver demographics (i.e., age, sex, race, education, marital status, and individual annual income) and patients' diagnoses and completion of AD. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to model predictors for patients' AD completion. Results: Over half of our patient sample (59%) completed an AD. Patients who were older, diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and with a caregiver who was Caucasian or declined to report an income level were more likely to have an AD in place. Significance of results: Our results suggest that both patient and caregiver characteristics may influence patients' decisions to complete an AD at the end of life.

Conventional wisdom suggests not, given the effortless ease with which we perceive three-dimensional (3D) scenes on opening our eyes. Here, we show evidence to the contrary. In Experiment 1, the observer judged the location of a briefly presented target, placed either on the textured ground or ceiling surface. Judged location was more accurate for a target on the ground, provided that the ground was visible and that the observer directed attention to the lower visual field, not the upper field. This reveals that attention facilitates space perception with reference to the ground. Experiment 2 showed that judged location of a target in mid-air, with both ground and ceiling surfaces present, was more accurate when the observer directed their attention to the lower visual field; this indicates that the attention effect extends to visual space above the ground. These findings underscore the role of attention in anchoring visual orientation in space, which is arguably a primal event that enhances one's ability to interact with objects and surface layouts within the visual space. The fact that the effect of attention was contingent on the ground being visible suggests that our terrestrial visual system is best served by its ecological niche.",0.4391304347826087
Primary motor cortex activation during action observation of tasks at different video speeds is dependent on movement task and muscle properties,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010917669&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2017.00010&partnerID=40&md5=37989419f8a1312055ef0566ef991e26,"The aim of the present study was to investigate how the video speed of observed action affects the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1), as assessed by the size of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Twelve healthy subjects observed a video clip of a person catching a ball (Experiment 1: rapid movement) and another 12 healthy subjects observed a video clip of a person reaching to lift a ball (Experiment 2: slow movement task). We played each video at three different speeds (slow, normal and fast). The stimulus was given at two points of timing in each experiment. These stimulus points were locked to specific frames of the video rather than occurring at specific absolute times, for ease of comparison across different speeds. We recorded MEPs from the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADM) of the right hand. MEPs were significantly different for different video speeds only in the rapid movement task. MEPs for the rapid movement task were higher when subjects observed an action played at slow speed than normal or fast speed condition. There was no significant change for the slow movement task. Video speed was effective only in the ADM. Moreover, MEPs in the ADM were significantly higher than in the FDI in a rapid movement task under the slow speed condition. Our findings suggest that the M1 becomes more excitable when subjects observe the video clip at the slow speed in a rapid movement, because they could recognize the elements of movement in others. Our results suggest the effects of manipulating the speed of the viewed task on the excitability of the M1 during passive observation differ depending on the type of movement task observed. It is likely that rehabilitation in the clinical setting will be more efficient if the video speed is changed to match the task's characteristics. © 2017 Moriuchi, Matsuda, Nakamura, Matsuo, Nakashima, Nishi, Fujiwara, Iso, Nakane and Higashi.",0.4423676012461059
Influence of ongoing task difficulty and motivation level on children's prospective memory in a Chinese sample,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014002802&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00089&partnerID=40&md5=95497876be53212b50253d9c2a098c81,"Prospective memory (PM) is the process associated with the task of realizing delayed intentions in the future. Researchers distinguish two types of PM, namely time-based PM (tbPM) and event-based PM (ebPM). Experiment 1 investigated the developmental trajectory of 3-to 5-year-old preschool children's PM ability, and the occurrence of delayed retrieval (children execute the PM task in a larger window of opportunity) in both tbPM and ebPM tasks. Results revealed that the 5-year-old children outperformed the 3-and 4-year-old children in PM. Moreover, delayed retrieval was more likely to occur in tbPM task than in ebPM task. In Experiment 2, the influence of ongoing task (OT) difficulty on PM performance was investigated with a sample of 5-year-old children. Results revealed no significant effect of OT difficulty on PM performance. In Experiment 3, we improved children's motivation level to complete the OT, then explored the influence of OT difficulty on children's PM performance. Results revealed that the effect of OT difficulty on PM performance became significant after increasing the children's motivation to complete the OT. These results provide insights into the mechanism of attentional resource allocation in PM tasks and have crucial educational and social implications. © 2017 Han, Han, Bian, Tian, Xu and Gao.",0.39593908629441626
Effect of Gum Chewing Frequency on Oxygenation of the Prefrontal Cortex,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009486461&doi=10.1177%2f0031512516683074&partnerID=40&md5=9d899aff04e5ab3ef8d9e8ce3b26bf47,"Since increased cerebral oxygenation reflects cerebral activation, this study investigated the effect of mastication frequency on prefrontal cortex oxygenation. Eleven young volunteers (nine women, two men; M age = 20.9 years, SD = 0.9) carried out three trials in which they were asked to chew a tasteless gum for 3 min at varying (rates of mastication frequency: 30, 70, and 110). Breaks of 2 min each were interleaved between trials. The oxygenation of the left prefrontal cortex was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. We found a significant increase in cortical oxygenation during gum chewing in all three conditions (p <.05), compared with a resting level; we also found a significant difference between the Fast and Slow chewing conditions, and between the Fast and Normal (70 rpm) conditions, both findings seemingly related to activation of a motor command in frontal brain regions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of mastication frequency on cerebral oxygenation.

In the present study, we explored the EEG correlates of ten different positive emotions (joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe, and love). A group of 20 participants were invited to watch 30 short film clips with their EEGs simultaneously recorded. Distinct topographical patterns for different positive emotions were found for the correlation coefficients between the subjective ratings on the ten positive emotions per film clip and the corresponding EEG spectral powers in different frequency bands. Based on the similarities of the participants’ ratings on the ten positive emotions, these emotions were further clustered into three representative clusters, as ‘encouragement’ for awe, gratitude, hope, inspiration, pride, ‘playfulness’ for amusement, joy, interest, and ‘harmony’ for love, serenity. Using the EEG spectral powers as features, both the binary classification on the higher and lower ratings on these positive emotions and the binary classification between the three positive emotion clusters, achieved accuracies of approximately 80% and above.

This paper examines the influence of personality factors on RDB and the mediating role of intention and attitude in the relationship. The influence of different SES, personality, marital status, and gender characteristics on attitude, intention, and risky driving was also examined. A sample of 354 fully licensed Ghanaian drivers, including 278 males and 76 females, participated in the study at two times points separated by three months. The correlation results showed that unhealthy family relationship and negative emotions were positively associated with illegal speed-related behaviors, risky driving, and accident involvement. The results of a structural equation model suggested that personality variables significantly and positively influence intention and attitude toward speeding, with normlessness directly and positively influencing RBD. The mediation analysis shows that intention mediated the effects of personality variables on RBD. No significant mediating effect for attitude was found. The analysis of variance result shows that drivers with high socioeconomic status and personality had the high intention and attitude toward speeding and reported more RDB. Finally, drivers who had been divorced significantly reported more positive attitude toward speeding than the married and single group. Based on the results, the study concludes that, in accessing the effect of personality measures on RDB, it is important to include intention as a possible mediator for more accurate decision. Practical implications for managing different personalities and socioeconomic positions are also discussed. © 2017 The Author(s).

First, the present study proposed that WIF mediates the negative relationship between schedule control and emotional exhaustion, and emotional exhaustion also mediates the negative relationship between schedule control and WIF. Second, family time adequacy was expected to play an amplifying role in the first path of the two mediations. Using a sample of 563 employees and adopting hierarchical linear modelling, the three-wave study first revealed that the emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between schedule control and WIF while WIF also mediates the schedule control-emotional exhaustion relationship, which demonstrated a reciprocal mediation. Furthermore, the relationship between schedule control and emotional exhaustion, as well as the indirect effects of schedule control on WIF via emotional exhaustion, were stronger for employees with higher family time adequacy.

Using school-based population data over a 15-year period (1998 to 2013), multivariate logistic regressions were used to calculate age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) separately by gender. Interactions were included to test widening or narrowing disparities within orientation groups, which makes this one of the first studies to test whether gaps in disparities between heterosexual and sexual minorities have widened or narrowed over time. Results show that sexual minority youth are persistently at a greater risk for suicidal behavior, a trend that has continued particularly for bisexual youth of both sexes. Results also suggest that the gap in suicidal behavior is widening among some female sexual orientation groups, yet narrowing for other male sexual orientation groups. These findings have important public health implications, especially since we see decreases in suicidal behavior for heterosexual adolescents, but not in the same way for many sexual minority youth, despite advances in social acceptance of gay, lesbian, and bisexual issues in North America. © 2016.

It has been argued that each fundamental motive is activated by cues pertaining to threats or opportunities linked with each fundamental motive, and may be based on qualitatively different cognitive and neural systems. Steroid hormones influence specific neural systems and consumer behaviors rooted in diverse fundamental motives. By taking steroid sex hormones as examples of internal cues, we suggested that at least three fundamental motives (status attainment, mate attraction, and mate retention) may be explained by common cognitive and neural mechanisms. Consumer behaviors rooted in diverse fundamental motives, including status attainment, mate attraction, and mate retention, may be commonly explained by social motivations/vigilance (amygdala) and reward processing (reward-related brain regions). Neuroscientific tools may be useful for refining the fundamental motive framework, and for understanding more fully consumer behaviors rooted in evolutionary motives. © 2017 Psychologia Society.

In this paper, we mainly consider the parameter priors, in particular for the BDeu (Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform) and Jeffreys’ prior. In model selection, given examples, we typically consider how well a model explains the examples, how simple the model is, and choose the best one for the criteria. In this sense, if a model A is better than another model B for both of the two criteria, it is reasonable to choosethe model A. In this paper, we prove that the BDeu violates such a regularity and that we will face a fatal situation in BNSL: the BDeu tends to add a variable to the current parent set of a variable X even when the conditional entropy reaches zero. In general, priors should be reflected by the learner’s belief and should not be rejected from a general point of view. However, this paper suggests that the underlying belief of the BDeu contradicts our intuition in some cases, which has not been known until this paper appears. © 2016, The Behaviormetric Society.",0.4010416666666667

Previously, we reported a genome defense effect by the antioxidative activity of several types of blackcurrant extracts (BCEs) in yeast and human cell gene mutation assays. In this study, we determined if BCE exerted radioprotective activity against DNA damage, chromosomal aberration, and gene mutations in the TK6 human lymphoblastoid cell line. We prepared aqueous BCE extracted from mature fruits cultivated in the Aomori Prefecture, Japan. Findings: In the micronucleus test and TK gene mutation assay, TK6 cells were irradiated with 0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.500, and 1.000 Gy with or without 1.0 mg/mL BCE. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was measured using the fluorescent probe BES-H2O2-Ac. Induction of micronuclei and gene mutations by γ-irradiation exposure was suppressed in combination with BCE. In addition, BCE reduced intracellular H2O2 levels caused by γ-irradiation. Conclusions: Our findings clearly support the genome defense potential of blackcurrant against γ-induced DNA damage. We postulate that these genome defense activities are related to the antioxidant compounds in blackcurrant. © The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Previous functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that some brain regions, such as the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), are active during the response to emotional facial expressions in healthy participants, and lesion studies have demonstrated that damage to these structures impairs the recognition of facial expressions. However, it remains to be established whether individual differences in the structure of these regions could be associated with differences in the ability to recognize facial expressions. We investigated this issue using acquired structural magnetic resonance imaging, and assessed the performance of healthy adults with respect to recognition of the facial expressions of six basic emotions. The gray matter volume of the right IFG positively correlated with the total accuracy of facial expression recognition. This suggests that individual differences in the ability to recognize facial expressions are associated with differences in the structure of the right IFG. Furthermore, the mirror neuron activity of the IFG may be important for establishing efficient facial mimicry to facilitate emotion recognition. © The Author (2016).

Results showed that the impact of central executive load on reaction times and accuracy scores related to strategy use increased with the magnitude of the demands of the central executive, with central executive load playing an important role in strategy use. Sixth graders performed better than 4th graders in the application of appropriate strategies. Children's adaptability with respect to strategy choice was affected by the type and magnitude of the central executive load; children showed better adaptability under the no-load condition and the inconsistent/low load condition than under conditions with greater load. Grade level affected children's adaptability with respect to strategy choice, with 6th graders exhibiting significantly better performance than 4th graders. These results confirm that the development of central executive skills contributes to children's overall strategy use and adaptability.

Some evidence suggests that microstructural characteristics are processed independently of macrostructural features. However, the human visual system can interpret a variety of information about the physical world, enabling the recognition and semantic categorization of complex visual scenes at a glance. This remarkable perceptual ability relies heavily on holistic processing, which is achieved by estimating the global statistical summary of an image. On the other hand, texture is an important source of information for distinguishing between artificial and naturally occurring surfaces in images. In addition, it is reported that Japanese sound symbolic words are useful to express fine differences in texture and synesthetic characteristics. However, there is no evidence comparing the characteristics of surface texture perception between whole- and part-based images using sound symbolic words. The objective of the present study was to examine whether sound symbolic words for describing the surface texture perception differs between whole-based images related to the holistic processing and part-based images. In Experiment 1, we examined the effect of wholebased images in surface texture perception using sound symbolic words. In Experiment 2, we examined the effect of part-based images in surface texture perception using sound symbolic words.

More practical surrogate markers for preclinical AD would provide valuable tools. Thus, we sought to validate the utility of conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a screening method for preclinical AD. A total of 289 older participants who were cognitively normal at baseline were clinically followed up for analysis of MRS metabolites, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and myo-inositol (MI) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) for 7 years. The 289 participants were retrospectively divided into five groups 7 years after baseline: 200 (69%) remained cognitively normal; 53 (18%) developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 21 (7%) developed AD; eight (2%) developed Parkinson's disease with normal cognition, and seven (2%) developed dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The NAA/MI ratios of the PCC in the AD, MCI, and DLB groups were significantly decreased compared with participants who maintained normal cognition from baseline to 7 years after baseline. MMSE scores 7 years after baseline were significantly correlated with MI/Cr and NAA/MI ratios in the PCC. These results suggest that cognitively normal elderly subjects with low NAA/MI ratios in the PCC might be at risk of progression to clinical AD. Thus, the NAA/MI ratio in the PCC measured with conventional 1 H MRS should be reconsidered as a possible adjunctive screening marker of preclinical AD in clinical practice. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Most previous studies suggested that IOR was not modulated by emotional cues. However, one key question they ignored was that only supraliminal presentation of emotional stimuli was used in their experiments. The present experiment is aimed at exploring the possible interaction between the IOR effect and subliminal emotional process. We manipulated three different kinds of valence strength of negative stimuli (high negative, HN; moderate negative, MN; low negative, LN) which were presented under the subliminal perception level and an event-related potentials (ERPs) recording was adopted. The results showed that, compared to MN and HN, the IOR effect triggered by peripheral cues was more significant for LN with aspects of behavioral and electrophysiological data (a reduction P1 effect, more negative on cued trials than on uncued trials for both early posterior Nd and Nd components). This indicated that IOR can be modulated by emotionally relevant stimuli.

Smartphone viewing distance and sleep: An experimental study utilizing motion capture technology,2017,42,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032258667&doi=10.2147%2fNSS.S123319&partnerID=40&md5=5af002d1dfd7d44063aeea2be1b1f82e,"There are studies reporting the negative impact of smartphone utilization on sleep. It is considered that reduction of melatonin secretion under the blue light exposure from smartphone displays is one of the causes. The viewing distance may cause sleep disturbance, because the viewing distance determines the screen illuminance and/or asthenopia. However, to date, there has been no study closely investigating the impact of viewing distance on sleep; therefore, we sought to determine the relationship between smartphone viewing distance and subjective sleep status. Twenty-three nursing students (mean age ± standard deviation of 19.7±3.1 years) participated in the study. Subjective sleep status was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, morningness-eveningness questionnaire, and the Epworth sleepiness scale. We used the distance between the head and the hand while holding a smartphone to measure the viewing distance while using smartphones in sitting and lying positions. The distance was calculated using the three-dimensional coordinates obtained by a noncontact motion-sensing device. The viewing distance of smartphones in the sitting position ranged from 13.3 to 32.9 cm among participants. In the lying position, it ranged from 9.9 to 21.3cm. The viewing distance was longer in the sitting position than in the lying position (mean ± standard deviation: 20.3±4.7 vs 16.4±2.7, respectively, P<0.01). We found that the short viewing distance in the lying position had a positive correlation to a poorer sleep state (R2=0.27, P<0.05), lower sleep efficiency (R2=0.35, P<0.05), and longer sleep latency (R2=0.38, P<0.05). Moreover, smartphone viewing distances in lying position correlated negatively with subjective sleep status. Therefore, when recommending ideal smartphone use in lying position, one should take into account the viewing distances. © 2017 Yoshimura et al.",0.4621212121212121
The behavioural paths to Wellbeing: An exploratory study to distinguish between hedonic and eudaimonic Wellbeing from an activity perspective,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033804890&doi=10.1017%2fprp.2017.1&partnerID=40&md5=c23ce1029cd555dcd6604bdab68a4928,"Hedonic wellbeing and eudaimonic wellbeing are two prevailing approaches to wellbeing. However, remarkably little research has distinguished them from an activity perspective; the knowledge of behavioural paths for achieving these two wellbeings is poor. This study first clarified the behavioural contents of the two approaches through a bottom-up method and then analysed the representativeness of activities to indicate to what extent activities contributed to wellness. We found that the paths to hedonic wellbeing and eudaimonic wellbeing overlapped and differed from each other. Furthermore, this study explained why hedonic activity differed from eudaimonic activity by analysing activity characteristics. We found that people reported higher frequency, sensory experience, and affective experience in hedonic activity, whereas they reported higher intellectual experience, behavioural experience, and spiritual experience in eudaimonic activity. Finally, we explored the behavioural pattern of wellbeing pursuit in both an unthreatening situation and a threatening situation. We found that the overlap between the two approaches increased in the threatening situation. Moreover, people in the threatening situation tended to score lower on all characteristics except frequency relative to those in the unthreatening situation. It seemed that the behavioural pattern in the threatening situation was less effective than its equivalent in the unthreatening situation. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.39603960396039606
Low-level pixelated representations suffice for aesthetically pleasing contrast adjustment in photographs,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031778710&doi=10.2298%2fPSI1703239G&partnerID=40&md5=a67d5801fd9e2f549f96e327e7c38a03,"Today's web-based automatic image enhancement algorithms decide to apply an enhancement operation by searching for ""similar"" images in an online database of images and then applying the same level of enhancement as the image in the database. Two key bottlenecks in these systems are the storage cost for images and the cost of the search. Based on the principles of computational aesthetics, we consider storing task-relevant aesthetic summaries, a set of features which are sufficient to predict the level at which an image enhancement operation should be performed, instead of the entire image. The empirical question, then, is to ensure that the reduced representation indeed maintains enough information so that the resulting operation is perceived to be aesthetically pleasing to humans. We focus on the contrast adjustment operation, an important image enhancement primitive. We empirically study the efficacy of storing a pixelated summary of the 16 most representative colors of an image and performing contrast adjustments on this representation. We tested two variants of the pixelated image: a ""mid-level pixelized version"" that retained spatial relationships and allowed for region segmentation and grouping as in the original image and a ""low-level pixelized-random version"" which only retained the colors by randomly shuffling the 50 × 50 pixels. In an empirical study on 25 human subjects, we demonstrate that the preferred contrast for the low-level pixelized-random image is comparable to the original image even though it retains very few bits and no semantic information, thereby making it ideal for image matching and retrieval for automated contrast editing. In addition, we use an eye tracking study to show that users focus only on a small central portion of the low-level image, thus improving the performance of image search over commonly used computer vision algorithms to determine interesting key points. © 2017 by the Serbian Psychological Association.",0.4610169491525424
The positivity bias phenomenon in face perception given different information on ability,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032586630&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00570&partnerID=40&md5=202be1583f37c37e97ad2e2ba5a491c9,"The negativity bias has been shown in many fields, including in face processing. We assume that this bias stems from the potential threat inlayed in the stimuli (e.g., negative moral behaviors) in previous studies. In the present study, we conducted one behavioral and one event-related potentials (ERPs) experiments to test whether the positivity bias rather than negativity bias will arise when participants process information whose negative aspect involves no threat, i.e., the ability information. In both experiments, participants first completed a valence rating (negative-to-positive) of neutral facial expressions. Further, in the learning period, participants associated the neutral faces with high-ability, low-ability, or control sentences. Finally, participants rated these facial expressions again. Results of the behavioral experiment showed that compared with pre-learning, the expressions of the faces associated with high ability sentences were classified as more positive in the post-learning expression rating task, and the faces associated with low ability sentences were evaluated as more negative. Meanwhile, the change in the high-ability group was greater than that of the low-ability group. The ERP data showed that the faces associated with high-ability sentences elicited a larger early posterior negativity, an ERP component considered to reflect early sensory processing of the emotional stimuli, than the faces associated with control sentences. However, no such effect was found in faces associated with low-ability sentences. To conclude, high ability sentences exerted stronger influence on expression perception than did low ability ones. Thus, we found a positivity bias in this ability-related facial perceptual task. Our findings demonstrate an effect of valenced ability information on face perception, thereby adding to the evidence on the opinion that person-related knowledge can influence face processing. What's more, the positivity bias in non-threatening surroundings increases scope for studies on processing bias. © 2017 Zhao, Xiang, Xie, Ye, Li and Mo.",0.4560810810810811
Trypophobic discomfort is spatial-frequency dependent,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029897071&doi=10.5709%2facp-0222-2&partnerID=40&md5=e2955a3c1bac71dc6cf9d60bbf82a407,"Clusters of holes, such as those in a lotus seedpod, induce trypophobicdiscomfort. Previous research has demonstrated that high-contrast energy at midrange spatial frequencies in images causes trypophobic discomfort. The present study examined the effects on discomfort of eliminating various spatial frequency components from the images to reveal how each spatial frequency contributes to the discomfort. Experiment 1 showed that eliminating midrange spatial frequencies did not affect trypophobic discomfort, while Experiment 2 revealed that images of holes that consisted of only high-spatial frequencies evoked less discomfort than other images and that images containing only low or midrange spatial frequencies induced as much trypophobic discomfort as did the original images. Finally, Experiment 3 found that participants with a high level of the trypophobic trait experienced stronger discomfort from the original images and the images containing only low or midrange spatial frequencies than participants with a low level of the trypophobic trait. Our findings thus suggest that trypophobic discomfort can be induced by middle and low spatial frequencies.",0.4444444444444444
High-performance work system and employee creativity: The roles of perceived organisational support and devolved management,2017,90,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034745605&doi=10.1108%2fPR-09-2016-0235&partnerID=40&md5=cef4234b41cb38973ed878faadb777ef,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the underlying mechanism through which high-performance work system (HPWS) influences employee creativity. In addition, this paper aims to examine contingent factors in the relationship between perceived organisational support and employee creativity. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of the study included 268 employees and matched supervisors from two pesticide chemical companies in China. Hypotheses were tested with linear regressions. Findings: The study shows that HPWS enhances perceived organisational support, which in turn promotes employee creativity. Moreover, the results also indicate that devolved management positively moderates the relationship between perceived organisational support and employee creativity. Research limitations/implications: The unique environment of China may limit the generalisability of the findings. Future studies can extend these findings by conducting studies in other societal contexts. Practical implications: When trying to inspire employee creativity, organisations need to pay attention to employees’ perception of organisational support. One way of enhancing perceived organisational support is to implement HPWS. In addition, organisations need to encourage devolved management in order to inspire more creative behaviours. Originality/value: This is the first study that explores the mediating role of perceived organisational support in the HPWS-employee creativity linkage. In addition, the study provides what is believed to be the first test of the moderating role of devolved management. © 2017, © Guiyao Tang, Bingjie Yu, Fang Lee Cooke and Yang Chen.",0.5067873303167421
Exploring terra incognita of cognitive science: Lateralization of gene expression at the frontal pole of the human brain,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031997085&doi=10.11621%2fpir.2017.0316&partnerID=40&md5=08dd963fe83081f78109139e2328cb92,"Background. Rostral prefrontal cortex, or frontopolar cortex (FPC), also known as Brodmann area 10 (BA10), is the most anterior part of the human brain. It is one of the largest cytoarchitectonic areas of the human brain that has significantly increased its volume during evolution. Anatomically the left (BA10L) and right (BA10R) parts of FPC show slight asymmetries and they may have distinctive cognitive functions. Objective. In the present study, we investigated differential expression of the transcriptome in the left and right parts of BA10. Design. Postmortem samples of human brain tissue from fourteen donors (male/ female without history of psychiatric and neurological diseases, mean age 39.79±3.23 years old, mean postmortem interval 12.10±1.76 h) were obtained using the resources of three institutions: the Partner Institute of Computational Biology of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and NIH Neuro- BioBank. Results. By using a standard RNA-sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis, we identified 61 genes with differential expression in the left and right FPC. In general, gene expression was increased in BA10R relative to BA10L: 40 vs. 21 genes, respectively. According to gene ontology analysis, the majority of up-regulated genes in BA10R belonged to the protein-coding category, whereas protein-coding and non-coding genes were equally up-expressed in BA10L. Most of the up-regulated genes in BA10R were involved in brain plasticity and activity-dependent mechanisms also known for their role in the hippocampus. 24 out of 30 mental disorder-related genes in the dataset were disrupted in schizophrenia. No such a wide association with other mental disorders was found. Conclusion. Discovered differences point at possible causes of hemispheric asymmetries in the human frontal lobes and at the molecular base of higher-order cognitive processes in health and disease. © Russian Psychological Society, 2017.",0.3892857142857143

Objective: To evaluate longer-Term prediction of MCI to AD conversion using 18F-FDG-PET and MRI in a multicenter study. Methods: One-hundred and fourteen patients with MCI were followed for 5 years. They underwent clinical and neuropsychological examinations, 18F-FDG-PET, and MRI at baseline. PET images were visually classified into predefined dementia patterns. PET scores were calculated as a semi quantitative index. For structural MRI, z-scores in medial temporal area were calculated by automated volume-based morphometry (VBM). Results: Overall, 72% patients with amnestic MCI progressed to AD during the 5-year follow-up. The diagnostic accuracy of PET scores over 5 years was 60% with 53% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Visual interpretation of PET images predicted conversion to AD with an overall 82% diagnostic accuracy, 94% sensitivity, and 53% specificity. The accuracy of VBM analysis presented little fluctuation through 5 years and it was highest (73%) at the 5-year follow-up, with 79% sensitivity and 63% specificity. The best performance (87.9% diagnostic accuracy, 89.8% sensitivity, and 82.4% specificity) was with a combination identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis that included PET visual interpretation, educational level, and neuropsychological tests as predictors. Conclusion: 18F-FDG-PET visual assessment showed high performance for predicting conversion to AD from MCI, particularly in combination with neuropsychological tests. PET scores showed high diagnostic specificity. Structural MRI focused on the medial temporal area showed stable predictive value throughout the 5-year course.",0.425

The lack of analytical clarity of the concept has not helped to address these questions. This article proposes a conceptual framework based on Amartya Sen’s capability approach, considering social exclusion as the denial of social relations that leads to serious deprivation of important capabilities. A person’s capabilities could potentially be improved through micro-, meso-, and macro-level social processes. At the micro level, sport-based social inclusion programmes could offer such social relations to varying degrees, though sport’s values are only relative to other leisure activities. The scale of impact depends primarily on the meso-level processes, in which the size and quality of each programme can be improved through organisational learning, and secondarily on the macro-level processes whereby the organisational population is institutionalised. It is argued that more research needs to be done on the meso and macro levels, as they are concerned with the ultimate potential of sport to facilitate structural transformation towards more socially inclusive society. © 2017 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",0.43414634146341463

Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were enrolled in this study and randomly divided into following 4 groups: control group (C group), molar loss group (ML group), 1-week physical exercise before molar loss group (1W-ML group), and 4-week physical exercise before molar loss group (4W-ML group). The rats both in 4W-ML and 1W-ML groups were placed in the voluntary running wheel in order to exercise for 4 weeks and 1 week, respectively. Then, the rats in 4W-ML, 1W-M, and ML groups received bilateral molar loss operation. After 10 days, striatal dopamine level was detected by in vivo microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrochemical detection. All the rats received behavior test after microdialysis detection. The behavior tests including passive avoidance test were used to assess cognition and elevated plus maze test for emotion. The results indicated that voluntary wheel running promoted striatal dopamine level in rats of molar loss. Behavioral data indicated that voluntary wheel running promoted cognition and emotion recovery after molar loss. Therefore, we concluded physical exercise significantly improved the neurocognitive behaviors and increased the striatal dopamine level after molar loss in rats. © 2017 Linlin Zhang et al.",0.47417840375586856

However, one main channel for mobile shopping, mobile shopping applications (apps), has not been thoroughly investigated. This study focused on mobile text advertising delivered from mobile shopping apps using the intention to purchase as the dependent variable for testing its marketing effect. In the context of a promotion focus vs. a prevention focus, we used Higgins' regulatory focus theory combined with Ajzen's TPB and Herzog's U & G to analyze the mechanism by which consumers formulate an intention to purchase in a mobile advertising context. This empirical study surveyed 320 consumers who had made a purchase using a mobile shopping app in the previous month. The results showed that infotainment, irritation, and subjective norms were significantly associated with attitudes; in turn, attitudes mediated the impact of these three factors on the intention to purchase. Moreover, a high promotion focus not only strengthened the positive effect of infotainment on attitudes but also intensified the mediation effect of attitudes between infotainment and the intention to purchase. A high prevention focus also consolidated the negative effect of irritation on attitudes as well as reinforced the mediation effect of attitudes between irritation and the intention to purchase. Furthermore, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control collectively impacted the intention to purchase. These findings shed light on ways to customize goods information in mobile advertising and have strong theoretical and practical implications. © 2017 Hongyan and Zhankui.",0.46938775510204084

Twelve patients with UVH and twelve age-matched control subjects were enrolled in the study. Thirty-four markers were attached to anatomical positions of each participant, and a three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis system was used to capture marker coordinates as the participants walked on a treadmill. The mean standard deviation of the rotation angles was used to represent gait variability. To explore gait stability, local dynamic stability was calculated from the trunk trajectory. The UVH group had wider step width and greater variability of roll rotation at the hip than the control group (P<0.05). Also, the UVH group had lower local dynamic stability in the medial-lateral (ML) direction than the control group (P<0.05). By linear regression analysis, we identified a linear relationship between the short-term Lyapunov exponent and vestibular functional asymmetry. The result implies that UVH-induced asymmetry can increase posture variability and gait instability. This study demonstrates the potential for using kinematic parameters to quantitatively evaluate the severity of vestibular functional asymmetry. Further studies will be needed to explore the clinical effectiveness of such approaches. © 2017 Peng Liu et al.",0.4461538461538462

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising method for quantifying brain recovery and investigating the intervention-induced changes in corticomotor excitability after stroke. This study aimed to evaluate cortical reorganization subsequent to virtual reality-enhanced treadmill (VRET) training in subacute stroke survivors. Methods. Eight participants with ischemic stroke underwent VRET for 5 sections per week and for 3 weeks. fMRI was conducted to quantify the activity of selected brain regions when the subject performed ankle dorsiflexion. Gait speed and clinical scales were also measured before and after intervention. Results. Increased activation in the primary sensorimotor cortex of the lesioned hemisphere and supplementary motor areas of both sides for the paretic foot (p<0.01) was observed postintervention. Statistically significant improvements were observed in gait velocity (p<0.05). The change in voxel counts in the primary sensorimotor cortex of the lesioned hemisphere is significantly correlated with improvement of 10 m walk time after VRET (r=-0.719). Conclusions. We observed improved walking and increased activation in cortical regions of stroke survivors after VRET training. Moreover, the cortical recruitment was associated with better walking function. Our study suggests that cortical networks could be a site of plasticity, and their recruitment may be one mechanism of training-induced recovery of gait function in stroke.

In addition to its function as an orexigenic stimulant, the role of ghrelin in the consolidation of learning and memory has been implicated in recent years. However, the status of circulating acylated ghrelin (AG, that is, the functional form of ghrelin) in the symptomatic predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has rarely been investigated. In the current study, we examined the serum levels of acylated and total ghrelin in 22 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 30 cognitively normal controls. We have found that patients with MCI had significantly increased serum AG levels, which were inversely associated with defected short- and long-term memory as well as language skills. Of note, the levels of total circulating ghrelin were similar between the two groups. Intriguingly, serum AG but not total ghrelin was associated with AD risk factors including the age, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Therefore, circulating AG may serve as a potential early systemic biomarker for AD-related cognitive impairments. Nevertheless, the simplest interpretation of the results is that the levels of circulating AG are associated with cognitive impairments in patients with MCI, thereby forming the groundwork for our future studies on the systemic mechanisms of AD pertaining to the ghrelin system. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

Resting-state EEG activity related to impulsivity in gambling disorder,2017,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031710779&doi=10.1556%2f2006.6.2017.055&partnerID=40&md5=633ad8d49c91f464cf9a7fd21f369b97,"Background and aims: Impulsivity is a core feature of gambling disorder (GD) and is related to the treatment response. Thus, it is of interest to determine objective neurobiological markers associated with impulsivity in GD. We explored resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in patients with GD according to the degree of impulsivity. Methods: In total, 109 GD subjects were divided into three groups according to Barratt impulsiveness scale-11 (BIS-11) scores: high (HI; 25th percentile of BIS-11 scores, n = 29), middle (MI; 26th-74th percentile, n = 57), and low-impulsivity (LI) groups (75th percentile, n = 23). We used generalized estimating equations to analyze differences in EEG absolute power considering group (HI, MI, and LI), brain region (frontal, central, and posterior), and hemisphere (left, midline, and right) for each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Results: The results indicated that GD patients in the HI group showed decreased theta absolute power, and decreased alpha and beta absolute power in the left, right, particularly midline frontocentral regions. Discussion and conclusions: This study is a novel attempt to reveal impulsive features in GD by neurophysiological methods. The results suggest different EEG patterns among GD patients according to the degree of impulsivity, raising the possibility of neurophysiological objective features in GD and helping clinicians in treating GD patients with impulsive features. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.41509433962264153
Syntactic enhancement: Bootstrapping for second language reading,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042349905&doi=10.17791%2fjcs.2017.18.4.473&partnerID=40&md5=18bce337ce014215cc95b16d8d2602d8,"This paper aimed to identify factors that inhibit effective second language (L2) reading and to suggest technology-enhanced reading designed for providing L2 readers with bootstrapping resources. To this end, this paper also addresses the importance of syntactic and prosodic awareness in L2 reading, drawing on L2 reading theories and a number of empirical studies from a body of research related to L2 development. Syntactic and prosodic awareness contribute to L2 reading development as they are highly associated with fluent and accurate reading abilities. However, it is challenging for L2 learners to acquire syntactic and prosodic knowledge due to limited cognitive capacities related to L2 learning, limited prior linguistic knowledge that is usually gained from oral communication, and linguistic differences between native languages and a target language. Addressing these challenges, this paper reviews a potentially useful technological tool of text presentation technology that may help increase syntactic awareness. Although empirical studies that tested the usefulness of technology-enhanced reading tools produced mixed results, their findings imply a viable alternative way of reading and call for future research to validate it. © 2017 Cognitive Science Society.",0.425414364640884
Progressive Motor Deficit is Mediated by the Denervation of Neuromuscular Junctions and Axonal Degeneration in Transgenic Mice Expressing Mutant (P301S) Tau Protein,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029506592&doi=10.3233%2fJAD-161206&partnerID=40&md5=b3f6df12522559662f5c4f62fb8ded55,"Tauopathies include a variety of neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathological aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau, resulting in progressive cognitive decline and motor impairment. The underlying mechanism for motor deficits related to tauopathy is not yet fully understood. Here, we use a novel transgenic tau mouse line, Tau 58/4, with enhanced neuron-specific expression of P301S mutant tau to investigate the motor abnormalities in association with the peripheral nervous system. Using stationary beam, gait, and rotarod tests, motor deficits were found in Tau 58/4 mice already 3 months after birth, which deteriorated during aging. Hyperphosphorylated tau was detected in the cell bodies and axons of motor neurons. At the age of 9 and 12 months, significant denervation of the neuromuscular junction in the extensor digitorum longus muscle was observed in Tau 58/4 mice, compared to wild-type mice. Muscle hypotrophy was observed in Tau 58/4 mice at 9 and 12 months. Using electron microscopy, we observed ultrastructural changes in the sciatic nerve of 12-month-old Tau 58/4 mice indicative of the loss of large axonal fibers and hypomyelination (assessed by g-ratio). We conclude that the accumulated hyperphosphorylated tau in the axon terminals may induce dying-back axonal degeneration, myelin abnormalities, neuromuscular junction denervation, and muscular atrophy, which may be the mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of the motor function in Tau 58/4 mice. Tau 58/4 mice represent an interesting neuromuscular degeneration model, and the pathological mechanisms might be responsible for motor signs observed in some human tauopathies. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Evolution of genotoxicity test methods in Japan,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031943478&doi=10.1186%2fs41021-016-0063-7&partnerID=40&md5=c570c29f950491cf5b8aafa68f3efea4,"The evolution of methods to assess genotoxicity of test compounds is thought to be one of the important subjects in The Japanese Environmental and Mutagen Society (JEMS). In 1970, the Ministry of Education of Japan (at that time) organized a research group (Organizer: Y. Tazima, National Institute of Genetics), and started a systematic research on the genotoxic effects induced by chemical substances. Considering the importance of this issue through the outcomes of the research group, JEMS was established in 1972, and President Tazima organized the 1st annual meeting in the August in Tokyo with the participation of experts in this field working in national institutes, universities and others in Japan. The discovery that food additives possessed genotoxic potential triggered various scientific activities in the field of genotoxicity. Another important point was the correlation between genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, in which the establishment of the reverse mutation assay played an important role. Other critical factors, such as side effects of drugs, occupational cancer, and environmental pollution due to genotoxic chemicals, emphasized the importance of genotoxicity tests for human safety. The tests performed to assess genotoxicity from 1960s to 1980s will be described to understand that many different genotoxic methodologies were discussed in these periods. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.36633663366336633
Association between transported Asian dust and outdoor fungal concentration during winter in a rural area of western Japan,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050128178&doi=10.1186%2fs41021-017-0079-7&partnerID=40&md5=1814618315bdcb3a9cb96ddcfc95d69e,"Background: Recently, Asian dust (AD) has become a serious health problem and several studies have clearly proven that AD can aggravate asthma. However, it remains unclear as to which components of AD have a strong effect on the asthma exacerbation caused by AD exposure. Outdoor fungi can increase emergency department visits and hospitalization for asthma exacerbation and can aggravate asthma symptoms. Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the relationship between AD and outdoor fungi and determining the potential of fungi to cause airborne particulate matter (PM)-related inflammatory responses. Methods: Airborne PM was collected each day from January 26, 2015 to February 27, 2015. Daily levels of outdoor fungi-associated PM were calculated using a culture-based method. Production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was assessed in THP1 cells stimulated by the collected airborne PM each day. Results: Daily levels of AD particles were assessed using Light Detection and Ranging and did not correlate with outdoor fungi (r = −0.17, P = 0.94). There was also no association between outdoor fungi and the daily production of IL-6 (r = 0.16, P = 0.37), IL-8 (r = 0.19, P = 0.30), or TNF-α induced by collected PM (r = 0.07, P = 0. 70). However, the daily levels of AD particles were significantly associated with IL-6 (r = 0.91, P < 0.0001), IL-8 (r = 0.64, P = 0.0004), and TNF-α (r = 0.72, P < 0.0001) production. Conclusion: AD did not increase the acute levels of outdoor fungi and outdoor fungi did not affect the cytokine production induced by airborne PM. These results suggest that outdoor fungi do not have any detectable effect on the asthma exacerbation caused by AD exposure. © The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Parents, nonparent women, and nonparent men were shown video clips that displayed several infant behaviours (e.g., playing with his/her mother). Then they were given two tasks. In a rating task, participants were asked to rate the likelihood of the filmed infant to have a mental state. On the other hand, in a description task, participants were instructed to explicitly describe the filmed infants' mental state in an open-ended manner. Importantly, all participants were asked to report the meaning of infants' behaviour in specific acts from the same set of infants' behaviours (e.g., the infants saw mother's face and smiled). The results revealed that parents and nonparent women significantly higher rated that infants were likely to express a mental state in the rating task than nonparent men did. On the other hand, parents were more likely to describe the filmed infants' mental states in the description task than nonparent women and nonparent men did. Results suggest that parents interpret more meanings from infants' behaviours compared to nonparents, even when both parents and nonparents equally focused on infants' behaviours. © 2017 Ikuko Shinohara and Yusuke Moriguchi.",0.3910891089108911

It has usually been assumed that our subjective feelings should change accordingly with changes in the objective environment. However, two counterintuitive effects reviewed in this article imply a rather complex psychological mechanism behind how people respond to environmental changes and strive for the freedom from fear and want. The first is the ‘psychological typhoon eye’ effect, in which the closer people are to hazards, the calmer they feel. Several possible explanations have been proposed, but the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear. The findings are important for future post-disaster interventions and helpful for policy makers in risk management and researchers in risk studies. The second effect is the ‘town dislocation’ effect, wherein although inhabitants’ objective quality of life is improved during the urbanisation process, the projected endorsement and rated social ambience of town residents is lower than that of residents in the country and in the city; this effect is mediated by social support. The findings have implications for how to better assess the urbanisation process and how to improve people’s affective appraisals of their living environment. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.47
Fat content modulates rapid detection of food: A visual search study using fast food and Japanese diet,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021251240&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01033&partnerID=40&md5=8194683f19c53c3d82b9dbea4530f055,"Rapid detection of food is crucial for the survival of organisms. However, previous visual search studies have reported discrepant results regarding the detection speeds for food vs. non-food items; some experiments showed faster detection of food than non-food, whereas others reported null findings concerning any speed advantage for the detection of food vs. non-food. Moreover, although some previous studies showed that fat content can affect visual attention for food, the effect of fat content on the detection of food remains unclear. To investigate these issues, we measured reaction times (RTs) during a visual search task in which participants with normal weight detected high-fat food (i.e., fast food), low-fat food (i.e., Japanese diet), and non-food (i.e., kitchen utensils) targets within crowds of non-food distractors (i.e., cars). Results showed that RTs for food targets were shorter than those for non-food targets. Moreover, the RTs for high-fat food were shorter than those for low-fat food. These results suggest that food is more rapidly detected than non-food within the environment and that a higher fat content in food facilitates rapid detection. © 2017 Sawada, Sato, Toichi and Fushiki.",0.45054945054945056
"CiAPEX2 and CiP0, candidates of AP endonucleases in Ciona intestinalis, have 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and contribute to protection against oxidative stress",2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052104073&doi=10.1186%2fs41021-017-0087-7&partnerID=40&md5=7957815c17b839cf3ebf4320e07ce224,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are one of the most frequent DNA lesions. AP sites inhibit transcription and DNA replication, and induce cell death. AP endonucleases are key enzymes in AP site repair. Several types of AP endonucleases have been reported, such as AP endonuclease 2 (APEX2) and ribosomal protein P0 (P0). However, it is not known how the functions and roles differ among AP endonucleases. To clarify the difference of roles among AP endonucleases, we conducted biochemical analysis focused on APEX2 and P0 homologues in Ciona intestinalis. Amino acid sequence analysis suggested that CiAPEX2 and CiP0 are AP endonuclease homologues. Although we could not detect AP endonuclease or 3′-phosphodiesterase activity, these two purified proteins exhibited 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. This 3′-5′ exonuclease activity was sensitive to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and the efficiency of this activity was influenced by the 3′-terminus of substrate DNA. Both CiAPEX2 and CiP0 degraded not only a 5′-protruding DNA end, but also nicked DNA, which is generated through AP endonuclease 1 (APEX1) cleavage. These two genes partially complemented the growth rate of AP endonuclease-deficient Escherichia coli treated with hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that 3′-5′ exonuclease activity is an evolutionarily conserved enzymatic activity of APEX2 and P0 homologues and this enzymatic activity may be important for AP endonucleases. © The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Of 39 adult rats used, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of the forelimbs of 15 rats were evaluated, before they received left C5 segmental hemisection of the spinal cord, by stimulating the pyramid of the medulla oblongata on one side using an exciting microelectrode. All 15 rats exhibited contralateral electrical activity, but their CMAPs disappeared after hemisection. The remaining 24 rats received hemisection first, and CMAPs of 12 rats were assessed over time to study their recovery time. All of them exhibited electrical activity of the forelimbs in 4 weeks after surgery. The remaining 12 rats received additional right C2 segmental hemisection, and variation of CMAPs between before and after surgery was examined. The right side of the 12 rats that received the additional hemisection exhibited no electrical activity in response to the stimulation of the pyramids on both sides. These results suggest that changes in path between the resected and healthy sides, activation of the ventral corticospinal tracts, and propriospinal neurons were involved in the recovery of motor function after cervical cord injury. © 2017 Takumi Takeuchi et al.",0.398989898989899

This study aims to analyze these possible mechanisms by comparing the effect of IA severity and childhood ADHD on inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in young adults with IA. We hypothesized that IA might have associations with ADHD-like cognitive and behavior symptoms aside from childhood ADHD. Methods: Study participants consisted of 61 young male adults. Participants were administered a structured interview. The severity of IA, childhood and current ADHD symptoms, and psychiatry comorbid symptoms were assessed through self-rating scales. The associations between the severity of IA and ADHD symptoms were examined through hierarchical regression analyses. Results: Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the severity of IA significantly predicted most dimensions of ADHD symptoms. By contrast, childhood ADHD predicted only one dimension. Discussion: The high comorbidity of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in IA should not solely be accounted by an independent ADHD disorder but should consider the possibility of cognitive symptoms related to IA. Functional and structural brain abnormalities associated with excessive and pathologic Internet usage might be related to these ADHD-like symptoms. Conclusion: Inattention and hyperactivity in young adults with IA are more significantly associated with the severity of IA than that of childhood ADHD. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.38596491228070173

We sought correlations between systolic and diastolic BP variability and cognitive function in community-dwelling older African Americans, and introduced a new BP variability measure that can be applied to BP data collected in clinical practice. Methods: We assessed cognitive function in 94 cognitively normal older African Americans using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (CAMCI). We used BP measurements taken at the patients' three most recent primary care clinic visits to generate three traditional BP variability indices, range, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation, plus a new index, random slope, which accounts for unequal BP measurement intervals within and across patients. Results: MMSE scores did not correlate with any of the BP variability indices. Patients with greater diastolic BP variability were less accurate on the CAMCI verbal memory and incidental memory tasks. Results were similar across the four BP variability indices. Conclusions: In a sample of cognitively intact older African American adults, BP variability did not correlate with global cognitive function, as measured by the MMSE. However, higher diastolic BP variability correlated with poorer verbal and incidental memory. By accounting for differences in BP measurement intervals, our new BP variability index may help alert primary care physicians to patients at particular risk for cognitive decline. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",0.4769874476987448

The dimensions of job satisfaction were analyzed by exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, and a structural equation model was constructed to discuss the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intention. First, for early-career employees, job satisfaction as a higher order factor consists of 6 first-order factors; personal growth’s influence on job satisfaction is the greatest, with a path coefficient reaching.918. Next come salary and welfare, work itself, interpersonal relationships and leader behavior. Additionally, job competency has a minimal effect on job satisfaction; its path coefficient is only.214. Second, job satisfaction has a significantly negative effect on turnover intention, indicating that the job satisfaction structure of early-career employees has its unique characteristics because they focus more on personal growth and development space.

Whole-day gait monitoring in patients with Alzheimer's disease: A relationship between attention and gait cycle,2017,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046881546&doi=10.3233%2fADR-170001&partnerID=40&md5=81cd35fa14271570f9c89dbb5a98eb48,"Background: Gait impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its relationship with cognitive function has been described, but reports of gait analysis in AD in daily living are limited. Objective: To investigate whether gait pattern of patients with AD in daily living is associated with cognitive function. Methods: Gait was recorded in 24 patients with AD and 9 healthy controls (HC) for 24 hours by using a portable gait rhythmogram. Mean gait cycle and gait acceleration were compared between the AD and HC groups. For the AD group, these gait metrics were assessed for correlations with cognitive function, as determined by the Mini Mental State Examination and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). Results: Although both gait parameters were not different between the patients with AD and HC, gait cycle in patients with AD was positively correlated with attention/concentration scores on the WMS-R (r = 0.578), and not with memory function. Patients with AD with attention scores as high as HC displayed a longer gait cycle than both HC (p = 0.048) and patients with AD with lower attention scores (p = 0.011). The patients with AD with lower attention scores showed a similar gait cycle with HC (p = 0.994). Conclusion: Patients with AD with impaired attentional function walk with faster gait cycle comparable to HC in daily living walking, which was unexpected based on previous gait analysis in clinical settings. This result probably reflects diminished consciousness to either the environment or instability of gait in the patients with AD with impaired attention. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Mitochondrial Dysfunction Triggers Synaptic Deficits via Activation of p38 MAP Kinase Signaling in Differentiated Alzheimer's Disease Trans-Mitochondrial Cybrid Cells,2017,37,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85022196946&doi=10.3233%2fJAD-170283&partnerID=40&md5=7279ffb033e56d813c8c47eb683a7f88,"Loss of synapse and synaptic dysfunction contribute importantly to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are early pathological features in AD-affected brain. However, the effect of AD mitochondria on synaptogenesis remains to be determined. Using human trans-mitochondrial ""cybrid"" (cytoplasmic hybrid) neuronal cells whose mitochondria were transferred from platelets of patients with sporadic AD or age-matched non-AD subjects with relatively normal cognition, we provide the first evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction compromises synaptic development and formation of synapse in AD cybrid cells in response to chemical-induced neuronal differentiation. Compared to non-AD control cybrids, AD cybrid cells showed synaptic loss which was evidenced by a significant reduction in expression of two synaptic marker proteins: synaptophysin (presynaptic marker) and postsynaptic density protein-95, and neuronal proteins (MAP-2 and NeuN) upon neuronal differentiation. In parallel, AD-mediated synaptic deficits correlate to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as well as activation of p38 MAP kinase. Notably, inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by pharmacological specific p38 inhibitor significantly increased synaptic density, improved mitochondrial function, and reduced oxidative stress. These results suggest that activation of p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway contributes to AD-mediated impairment in neurogenesis, possibly by inhibiting the neuronal differentiation. Our results provide new insight into the crosstalk of dysfunctional AD mitochondria to synaptic formation and maturation via activation of p38 MAP kinase. Therefore, blockade of p38 MAP kinase signal transduction could be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD by alleviating loss of synapses. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

Unconscious processing of facial expressions in individuals with internet gaming disorder,2017,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021227214&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01059&partnerID=40&md5=3992dfaa5ec71142d05a08c55cccb272,"Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is characterized by impairments in social communication and the avoidance of social contact. Facial expression processing is the basis of social communication. However, few studies have investigated how individuals with IGD process facial expressions, and whether they have deficits in emotional facial processing remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to explore these two issues by investigating the time course of emotional facial processing in individuals with IGD. A backward masking task was used to investigate the differences between individuals with IGD and normal controls (NC) in the processing of subliminally presented facial expressions (sad, happy, and neutral) with event-related potentials (ERPs). The behavioral results showed that individuals with IGD are slower than NC in response to both sad and neutral expressions in the sad-neutral context. The ERP results showed that individuals with IGD exhibit decreased amplitudes in ERP component N170 (an index of early face processing) in response to neutral expressions compared to happy expressions in the happy-neutral expressions context, which might be due to their expectancies for positive emotional content. The NC, on the other hand, exhibited comparable N170 amplitudes in response to both happy and neutral expressions in the happy-neutral expressions context, as well as sad and neutral expressions in the sad-neutral expressions context. Both individuals with IGD and NC showed comparable ERP amplitudes during the processing of sad expressions and neutral expressions. The present study revealed that individuals with IGD have different unconscious neutral facial processing patterns compared with normal individuals and suggested that individuals with IGD may expect more positive emotion in the happy-neutral expressions context. Highlights: • The present study investigated whether the unconscious processing of facial expressions is influenced by excessive online gaming. A validated backward masking paradigm was used to investigate whether individuals with Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and normal controls (NC) exhibit different patterns in facial expression processing. • The results demonstrated that individuals with IGD respond differently to facial expressions compared with NC on a preattentive level. Behaviorally, individuals with IGD are slower than NC in response to both sad and neutral expressions in the sad-neutral context. The ERP results further showed (1) decreased amplitudes in the N170 component (an index of early face processing) in individuals with IGD when they process neutral expressions compared with happy expressions in the happy-neutral expressions context, whereas the NC exhibited comparable N170 amplitudes in response to these two expressions; (2) both the IGD and NC group demonstrated similar N170 amplitudes in response to sad and neutral faces in the sad-neutral expressions context. • The decreased amplitudes of N170 to neutral faces than happy faces in individuals with IGD might due to their less expectancies for neutral content in the happy-neutral expressions context, while individuals with IGD may have no different expectancies for neutral and sad faces in the sad-neutral expressions context. © 2017 Peng, Cui, Wang and Jiao.",0.47468354430379744
"Giemsa-stained pseudo-micronuclei in rat skin treated with vitamin D3 analog, pefcalcitol",2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031914780&doi=10.1186%2fs41021-017-0077-9&partnerID=40&md5=8fd241c3619afb076ca46ea843464c0e,"Background: Pefcalcitol, an analog of vitamin D3 (VD3), is an anti-psoriatic drug candidate that is designed to achieve much higher pharmacological effects, such as keratinocyte differentiation, than those of VD3, with fewer side effects. Genotoxicity of the compound was evaluated in a rat skin micronucleus (MN) test. Results: In the rat skin MN test, pefcalcitol showed positive when specimens were stained with Giemsa, whereas neither an in vitro chromosome aberration test in CHL cells nor an in vivo bone marrow MN test in rats indicated clastogenicity. To elucidate the causes of the discrepancy, the MN specimens were re-stained with acridine orange (AO), a fluorescent dye specific to nucleic acid, and the in vivo clastogenicity of the compound in rat skin was re-evaluated. The MN-like granules that had been stained by Giemsa were not stained by AO, and AO-stained specimens indicated that pefcalcitol did not increase the frequency of micronucleated (MNed) cells. Histopathological evaluation suggested that the MN-like granules in the epidermis were keratohyalin granules contained in keratinocytes, which had highly proliferated after treatment with pefcalcitol. Conclusions: Pefcalcitol was concluded to be negative in the rat skin MN test. The present study demonstrated that Giemsa staining gave a misleading positive result in the skin MN test, because Giemsa stained keratohyalin granules. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.3018867924528302
Help others and yourself eventually: Exploring the relationship between help-giving and employee creativity under the model of perspective taking,2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021240451&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01030&partnerID=40&md5=b71924728159faffdf46f79e7fefbfd4,"Although a plethora of studies have examined the antecedents of creativity, empirical studies exploring the role of individual behaviors in relation to creativity are relatively scarce. Drawing on the model of perspective taking, this study examines the relationship between help-giving during creative problem solving process and employee creativity. Specifically, we test perspective taking as an explanatory mechanism and propose organization-based self-esteem as the moderator. In a sample collected from a field survey of 247 supervisor-subordinate dyads from 2 large organizations in China at 3 time points, we find that help-giving during creative problem solving process positively related with perspective taking; perspective taking positively related with employees' creativity; employees' organization-based self-esteem strengthened the link between perspective taking and creativity; besides, there existed a moderated mediation effect. We conclude this paper with discussions on the implications for theory, research, and practice. © 2017 Li and Liao.",0.4892086330935252

The present research examines the impact of uprooting stress on educational Chinese migrants and how students cope with the unanticipated pressure of leaving home. Using a sample of recent first-year students, we employed a longitudinal design that allowed us to examine the interaction effect of coping strategies (primary and secondary coping) and stress at time 1 and their impact on anxiety at time 2. Results indicated primary coping exerted an interaction effect on stress, exacerbating the negative effects and leading to more anxiety at time 2, but secondary coping did not. Females also reported lower stress and anxiety. In conclusion, the impact of uprooting stress and coping on psychological symptoms suggests further research on internal Chinese migration should consider the impact of within-culture variation in Mainland China. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.5578231292517006
Selective effects of sport expertise on the stages of mental rotation tasks with object-based and egocentric transformations,2017,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056543488&doi=10.5709%2facp-0225-x&partnerID=40&md5=a6c549093469c8d8e4563f721aed1232,"It is well established that motor expertise is linked to superior mental rotation ability, but few studies have attempted to explain the factors that influence the stages of mental rotation in sport experts. Some authors have argued that athletes are faster in the perceptual and decision stages but not in the rotation stages of object-based transformations; however, stimuli related to sport have not been used to test mental rotation with egocentric transformations. Therefore, 24 adolescent elite divers and 23 adolescent nonathletes completed mental rotation tasks with object-based and egocentric transformations. The results showed faster reaction times (RTRTs) for the motor experts in tasks with both types of transformations (object-based cube, object-based body, and egocentric body). Additionally, the differences in favour of motor experts in the perceptual and decision stages were confirmed. Interestingly, motor experts also outperformed nonathletes in the rotation stages in the egocentric transformations. These findings are discussed against the background of the effects of sport expertise on mental rotation. © 2017 University of Finance and Management in Warsaw.

Absence of in vivo mutagenicity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in single intratracheal instillation study using F344 gpt delta rats,2017,15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030154241&doi=10.1186%2fs41021-016-0065-5&partnerID=40&md5=c6f446096e0c968df0f037726b24eef8,"Introduction: It is known that fibrous particles of micrometer length, such as carbon nanotubes, which have same dimensions as asbestos, are carcinogenic. Carcinogenicity of nanomaterials is strongly related to inflammatory reactions; however, the genotoxicity mechanism(s) is unclear. Indeed, inconsistent results on genotoxicity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been shown in several reports. Therefore, we analyzed the in vivo genotoxicity induced by an intratracheal instillation of straight MWCNTs in rats using a different test system—the Pig-a gene mutation assay—that can reflect the genotoxicity occurring in the bone marrow. Since lungs were directly exposed to MWCNTs upon intratracheal instillation, we also performed the gpt assay using the lungs. Findings: We detected no significant differences in Pig-a mutant frequencies (MFs) between the MWCNT-treated and control rats. Additionally, we detected no significant differences in gpt MFs in the lung between the MWCNT-treated and control rats. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that a single intratracheal instillation of MWCNTs was non-mutagenic to both the bone marrow and lung of rats. ©  2017 The Author(s).",0.3433734939759036

We matched these participants to 5 controls each, and followed them for approximately 600 days. In the employee cohort, patients with EOD were more likely to leave their jobs than were controls (hazard ratio: 2.26).

EEG is the most important tool in diagnosis and follow-up in patients with seizures. To diagnose which children might experience recurring seizures, EEG can be helpful. This research was conducted to investigate risk factors of seizure recurrence in non-febrile seizures. Methods: In this descriptive study, EEGs were obtained from all children referred to Ahvaz Golestan hospital following an initial, unprovoked, and untreated seizure. Data were analysed by SPSS version 20, and P < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: Thirty-two children aged 4 months to 14 years participated. The patients mean age was 2.75 years. Eighteen cases (56.25%) were male and 14 (43.75%) were female. Twenty-seven of the cases had normal birth weight and five had low birth weight. Of the 32 children evaluated, five children (15.62%) had developmental retardation status. The average duration of seizures was 155 seconds. A positive family history of seizures was reported in 13 (40.62%) children. EEG findings were abnormal in 19 patients (59.37%), and they were normal in 13 patients (40.63%), in which three forms were seen: focal spikes in 10 patients (31.25%), focal spikes with slow waves in six patients (18.75%), and general spikes with slow waves in three patients (9.37%). Conclusion: This study revealed a significant correlation between the presence of a family history of seizures and developmental delays in children with first non-febrile seizures and abnormal EEG. It is suggested that EEG be conducted on the first non-febrile seizure, especially in children with a positive family history of seizures or developmental delay.",0.4166666666666667
An investigation of enhancement of ability evaluation by using a nested logit model for multiple-choice items; [Una investigación de la mejora de la capacidad de evaluación mediante el uso de un modelo logit anidado para items de elección múltiple],2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025633911&doi=10.6018%2fanalesps.33.3.238621&partnerID=40&md5=489cb98192d80ff986f2f698d39315cd,"Multiple-choice items are wildly used in psychological and educational test. The present study investigated that if a multiple-choice item have an advantage over a dichotomous item on ability or latent trait evaluation. An item response model, 2-parameter logistic nested logit model (2PL-NLM), was used to fit the multiple-choice data. Both simulation study and empirical study indicated that the accuracy and the stability of ability estimation were enhanced by using multiple-choice model rather than dichotomous model, because more information was included in multiple-choice items’ distractors. But the accuracy of ability estimation showed little differences in four-choice items, five-choice items and six-choice items. Moreover, 2PL-NLM could extract more information from low-level respondents than from high-level ones, because they had more distractor chosen behaviors. In the empirical study, respondents at different trait levels would be attracted by different distractors from the Chinese Vocabulary Test for Grade 1 by using the changing traces of distractor probabilities calculated from 2PL-NLM. It is suggested that the responses of students at different levels could reflect the students’ vocabulary development process. © 2017: Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.

Since insulin resistance is increased in AD neurons, we investigated the effects of APO on brain insulin resistance in 3xTg-AD mice at early and late stages. After 1-month subcutaneous injection of Apokyn® to 3xTg-AD mice at 6 or 12 months of age, memory function was significantly improved in both age groups. Protein levels of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which is linked to insulin signaling and degrades Aβ, significantly increased in the 3xTg-AD mice brain compared with non-transgenic mice, and were further increased by APO. Protein levels of two types of serine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), pS616 and pS636/639, significantly decreased following APO treatment in the 13-month-old 3xTg-AD mice brain, suggesting improved brain insulin resistance. Immunostaining of the IDE, pS616 and pS636/639 IRS-1 demonstrated similar changes due to APO treatment. Thus, brain insulin resistance is considered an important therapeutic target in AD, and APO may provide improved neuronal insulin resistance. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Magnetic resonance imaging and memory function measurements (Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese revised, WMS-CR) were applied at both the beginning and end of the study. Results showed that both Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin could significantly increase grey matter volume (GMV) in the insula, medial temporal lobe, and putamen after 12-weeks of exercise. No significant differences were observed in GMV between the Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin groups. We also found that compared to healthy controls, Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin significantly improved visual reproduction subscores on the WMS-CR. Baduanjin also improved mental control, recognition, touch, and comprehension memory subscores of the WMS-CR compared to the control group. Memory quotient and visual reproduction subscores were both associated with GMV increases in the putamen and hippocampus.

The Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese version (ABC-J), the Food Related Problem Questionnaire (FRPQ), and the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS) were administered to 65 PWS patients, including 20 adolescents (ages 12 to 17) and 45 young adults (ages 18 to 29). Significant differences (Mann-Whitney U tests) were found in ABC-J (p=0.004) and PARS (p=0.021), with lower scores in adolescents than in young adults. While DEL subgroups showed no significant differences between the two age groups in ABC-J (p=0.063) and PARS (p=0.134), mUPD subgroups showed a statistically significant difference in terms of ABC-J (p=0.007). No significant differences were found between adolescents and young adults, in terms of FRPQ (p=0.163). These results suggest that aberrant and autistic behaviors follow a marked worsening trend from around the age of 18.

Accurate differential diagnosis strongly influences the long-term outcome of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. Objective: The aim of this study was to find potential CSF microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers for NPH mimics with parkinsonian syndromes that can reliably distinguish them from iNPH patients. Methods: Two cohorts of 81 patients (cohort 1, n = 55; cohort 2, n = 26) with possible iNPH who were treated in two centers between January 2011 and May 2014 were studied. In both cohorts, CSF samples were obtained from patients clinically diagnosed with iNPH (n = 21 and n = 10, respectively), possible iNPH with parkinsonian spectrum (PS) (n = 18, n = 10, respectively), possible iNPH with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 16), and non-affected elderly individuals (NC) (n = 6). A three-step qRT-PCR analysis of the CSF samples was performed to detect miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the groups. Results: The expression of hsa-miR-4274 in CSF was decreased in both cohorts of PS group patients (cohort 1: p < 0.0001, cohort 2: p < 0.0001), and was able to distinguish PS from iNPH with high accuracy (area under the curve = 0.908). The CSF concentration of hsa-miR-4274 also correlated with the specific binding ratio of ioflupane (123I) dopamine transporter scan (r =-0.494, p = 0.044). By contrast, the level of hsa-miR-4274 was significantly increased in the PS group after CSF diversion. Conclusion: Levels of CSF hsa-miR-4274 can differentiate PS from patients with iNPH, AD, and NC.

We concluded that extensive reading increases knowledge of Japanese letters (in particular, the knowledge of the connections between hiragana and kanji). In addition, distinctive features of both indices of reading amount-TRT and school book borrowing-are discussed; school book borrowing, in particular, has not been used as an index of reading amount in previous studies, so we assert its utility here. © 2017 Psychologia Society.

Objective: The primary objective of the present study was to estimate how large a sample size would be needed for future clinical trials for AD-modifying treatments in Japan using atrophy measures of the brain as a surrogate biomarker. Methods: Sample sizes were estimated from the rates of change of the whole brain and hippocampus by the k-means normalized boundary shift integral (KN-BSI) and cognitive measures using the data of 537 Japanese Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) participants with a linear mixed-effects model. We also examined the potential use of ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy. Results: The hippocampal atrophy rate required smaller sample sizes than cognitive measures of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Inclusion of ApoE status reduced sample sizes for AD and MCI patients in the atrophy measures. Conclusion: These results show the potential use of longitudinal hippocampal atrophy measurement using automated image analysis as a progression biomarker and ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy in a clinical trial of AD-modifying treatment in Japanese people. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.,0.4827586206896552

As one of them, I introduce some historic topics here. These include 1) establishment of JEMS, 2) the issue of 2-(2-furyl)-3-(3-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2), 3) the Mammalian Mutagenicity Study Group (MMS) and its achievements, and 4) the Collaborative Study Group of the Micronucleus Test (CSGMT) and its achievements. In addition to these historic matters, some of which are still ongoing, a new collaborative study is proposed on adaptive response or hormesis by mutagens. There is a close relationship between mutagens and carcinogens, the dose-response relationship of which has been thought to follow the linear no-threshold model (LNT). LNT was fabricated on the basis of Drosophila sperm experiments using high dose radiation delivered in a short period. The fallacious 60 years-old LNT is applied to cancer induction by radiation without solid data and then to cancer induction by carcinogens also without solid data. Therefore, even the smallest amount of carcinogens is postulated to be carcinogenic without thresholds now. Radiation hormesis is observed in a large variety of living organisms; radiation is beneficial at low doses, but hazardous at high doses. There is a threshold at the boundary between benefit and hazard. Hormesis denies LNT. Not a few papers report existence of chemical hormesis. If mutagens and carcinogens show hormesis, the linear dose-response relationship in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis is denied and thresholds can be introduced. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.4083333333333333

Patients with AD have alterations in cerebral hemodynamic function including reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate. Therefore, improved cerebrovascular function may be an attractive goal for pharmaceutical intervention in AD. Objective: We wished to observe the acute effects of sildenafil on cerebrovascular function and brain metabolism in patients with AD. Methods: We used several novel non-invasive MRI techniques to investigate the alterations of CBF, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2), and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) after a single dose of sildenafil administration in order to assess its physiological effects in patients with AD. CBF, CMRO 2, and CVR measurements using MRI were performed before and one hour after the oral administration of 50 mg sildenafil. Baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was also obtained. Results: Complete CBF and CMRO 2 data were obtained in twelve patients. Complete CVR data were obtained in eight patients. Global CBF and CMRO 2 significantly increased (p = 0.03, p = 0.05, respectively) following sildenafil administration. Voxel-wise analyses of CBF maps showed that increased CBF was most pronounced in the bilateral medial temporal lobes. CVR significantly decreased after administration of sildenafil.

"Strategic flexibility, innovative HR practices, and firm performance: A moderated mediation model",2017,55,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034773336&doi=10.1108%2fPR-09-2016-0252&partnerID=40&md5=ffa2a9471f9eb18afeb3c59b534a2f9e,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of innovative HR practices as an important mechanism through which strategic flexibility affects firm performance as well as the role of female leadership in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered from a sample of 113 firms in China. The authors collected information on organizational strategy, HR practices, CEO information, corporate social responsibility and other firm characteristics in terms of firm age, location, and financial performance. Conditional procedural analysis was conducted to test the model. Findings: The authors found strong evidence in support of the mediation relationship in which organizations with a strong focus on strategic flexibility are more likely to adopt Innovative HR Practices. Furthermore, the authors found that the extent to which firms have adopted innovative HR practices has a strong effect on employee productivity. In addition, the authors found that female leadership enhances strategic flexibility-performance relationship. Research limitations/implications: Information on strategic flexibility, HR practices and firm performance was collected at the same time. Future studies based on panel data would be helpful to establish the causal relationships in the model. Practical implications: The authors’ findings suggest that practitioners should put more emphasis on developing innovative HR practices, as they are required by strategic flexibility. Social implications: Firms pursuing strategic flexibility should feel more confident when appointing a female CEO, because the results show that female leadership may enhance the positive impact of strategic flexibility on firm performance. Originality/value: This research study is the first empirical examination of the mediating influence of innovative HR practices on the relationship between strategic flexibility and firm performance. The study also shows that female leadership benefits an organization in implementing strategic flexibility. The results are of value to researchers, human resource management managers, employees, and executives who are seeking to develop practices that are flexible and innovative in order to stay competitive in dynamic environments. © 2017, © Lin Xiu, Xin Liang, Zhao Chen and Wei Xu.",0.4672897196261682
The role of presenter actions in the evaluation of oral presentations: Evidence from fmri and motion-vector analysis,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047114156&doi=10.2117%2fpsysoc.2017.44&partnerID=40&md5=6f907e3c89a82bb2de614a0c36f4fde3,"The present study aimed to explore the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the evaluation of oral presentations. The top 10 and bottom 10 TED presentations were selected from over 2,000 TED talks based on viewer ratings. Thin slices from these 20 videos were used as stimuli. The first experiment showed that the original ratings could be represented by evaluations of 30-sec clips. In the second experiment, fMRI BOLD signals from viewers were examined while they watched the thin-sliced TED talks. The results showed significantly greater activation in the parts of the occipitotemporal cortex related to visual motion and social cognition while watching the top 10 clips than when watching the bottom 10 clips. In the third experiment, the magnitude of motion in the video clips, as quantified by motion vectors, differed significantly between two distinct presentation groups. These results provide comprehensive evidence for the importance of presenter actions for oral presentations to be evaluated highly by audiences. © 2017 Psychologia Society. All  Rights Reserved.

The kindness of strangers: Exploring interdependencies and shared mobilities of elderly people in rural Japan,2017,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067137015&doi=10.17645%2fsi.v5i4.1125&partnerID=40&md5=f91400dd631ba5b4bd64da39aa5bdf39,"For over forty years, most residents in rural areas of Japan have relied on private vehicles to meet their mobility needs. Today, however, the rapid ageing of the population, coupled with low birth rates and migration of young people to urban areas, is posing a variety of new transport challenges. Most notably, the proportion of drivers to non-drivers is getting smaller. This means that non-drivers who relied on family and neighbours for trips in the past, as well as elderly residents who give up their licenses, have fewer people to drive them. Current policy debates tend to focus on technological “solutions”, and underestimate the complex social, cultural and inter-personal relationships which underlie transport dependencies in these environments. Using a qualitative semi-structured survey, the current study explores the current mobilities of older people living in a small rural district in Shimane Prefecture, Japan. The resulting analysis reveals how cultural attitudes and social norms affect the ways in which older people manage their mobilities. © 2017 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal)..",0.4556213017751479
Tau pathology promotes the reorganization of the extracellular matrix and inhibits the formation of perineuronal nets by regulating the expression and the distribution of hyaluronic acid synthases,2017,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041851957&doi=10.3233%2fJAD-160804&partnerID=40&md5=2b221004d92eab77fd6db4a33116c90a,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is the backbone of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and provides biochemical and physical support to aggrecan-based perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are associated with the selective vulnerability of neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we showed that HA synthases (HASs), including Has1, Has2, and Has3, were widely expressed in murine central nervous system. All types of HASs were localized to cell bodies of neurons; only Has1 existed in the membranes of neural axons. By using TauP301S transgenic (Tg) mouse model, we found that the axonal-localization of Has1 was abolished in TauP301S overexpressed mouse brain, and the redistribution of Has1 was also observed in human AD brains, suggesting that the localization of Has1 is dependent on intact microtubules which are regulated partially by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycles of tau proteins. Furthermore, Has1 was reduced and Has3 was increased in TauP301S Tg mouse brain, resulting in the upregulation of shorter-chain HA in the ECM. These findings suggest that by abolishing the axonal-localization of Has1 and promoting the expression of Has3 and the synthesis of shorter-chain HA, the tau pathology breaks the balance of ECM components, promotes the reorganization of the ECM, and inhibits the formation of PNNs in the hippocampus, and then regulates neuronal plasticity during the progression of AD. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Interpersonal benefits of defensive pessimism: Defensive pessimism and negative focus interact to predict positive evaluation,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054727161&doi=10.2117%2fpsysoc.2017.97&partnerID=40&md5=f15e8bd26b03c5c9c8796e12389d1063,"How do cognitive strategies and focusing on negative possibilities for an upcoming event interact to affect evaluation by others or interpersonal friction in social interactions? This study compares individuals who use defensive pessimism (DP), strategic optimism (SO), or realistic/regular pessimism (RP) as a cognitive strategy. Participants (23 DPs, 22 SOs, and 14 RPs) talked with a partner (who was a confederate in the experiment) after focusing on the possibilities of a negative event in the conversation (experimental condition) or waiting for several minutes (control condition). After the conversation, participants' perceived interpersonal friction was measured. Additionally, the confederates rated the participants' behavior and their impression of the conversations. The results showed that negatively-focused DPs were rated better than control DPs on several dimensions of their interactions (e.g., talked to confederate). Moreover, negatively-focused RPs reported more interpersonal friction than negatively-focused DPs, although there were no differences in evaluations by the confederates. © 2017 Psychologia Society.

Gene expression analyses have implicated SULF2 in disease pathogenesis, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), but changes in brain SULF2 expression have not been directly established. Objective: To investigate the expression of SULF1 and SULF2 in brain tissues from AD cases and cognitively normal controls. Methods: Autopsy tissue from AD cases (n = 20) and age-and gender-matched cognitively normal controls (n = 20) were identified from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry neuropathology database. Tissue slides were stained for SULF1 and SULF2 protein expression in the hippocampus and frontal lobe and an expression score computed from the proportion of cells stained and the intensity of staining (range 0 [no expression] to 9 [marked expression]). Results: SULF2 expression was reduced in AD cases. Compared to cognitively normal controls, SULF2 expression in AD cases was significantly decreased in the hippocampal Cornu Ammonis (CA) (mean score of 6.5 in cases versus 8.3 in controls; p = 0.003), in the gray matter of the parahippocampal gyrus (5.6 in cases versus 7.6 in controls; p = 0.003), and in the frontal lobe gray matter (5.4 in cases versus 7.4 in controls; p = 0.002). There was no difference in SULF1 expression in the hippocampus or frontal lobe of AD cases and controls. As expected there were no differences in SULF1 or SULF2 expression in white matter in AD cases compared to cognitively normal controls. Conclusion: Decreased SULF2 in specific regions of the brain occurs in AD. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",0.48582995951417
The effects of word predictability and contextual uncertainty in the processing of Korean dative sentences: An eye-movement reading comprehension study,2017,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027191409&doi=10.17791%2fjcs.2017.18.2.127&partnerID=40&md5=f1ec266cbbe8f3b731433d588598f2e4,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the conjoined roles of word predictability and contextual uncertainty in modeling readers' processing difficulty in the integration of recipients or patients into Korean dative sentences, by observing readers' eye movements in reading. The recipients and patients were arranged in a canonical order (i.e., recipient before patient) or a non-canonical order (i.e., patient before recipient). Using a cloze task, we measured a word's conditional probability to estimate the degree of predictability for a target word given a context. The outputs from the clozetype listing task were used to compute entropy-based contextual uncertainty corresponding to the degree of contextual constraint at the point in which target words would appear. While the effect of word predictability on eye movement in reading was being taken into account in linear mixed-effect models, the significant effect of contextual uncertainty emerged only in the processing of target words in non-canonical sentences in a way that words were read more rapidly as the strength of contextual uncertainty increased. Including the contextual-uncertainty factor in the model of word predictability improved the goodness of the model fit significantly in the condition of canonical sentences and marginally significantly in that of non-canonical sentences. Our results suggest that the role of contextual uncertainty is important to improve the model performance accounting for expectation-based probabilistic readers' behaviors during sentence comprehension. A weak context (i.e., high contextual uncertainty) in which a wide distribution of possible choices is constructed contributes to the reduction of processing difficulty, in particular, when readers do not make a strong commitment for upcoming structural information.",0.40304182509505704

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The mentoring scheme involved 12 matched pairs (mentor/mentee) meeting once per week for one hour, over a six-month period. All mentors attended a training day, led by the principles of personal construct theory and an emancipatory research ethos. The project and training involved significant involvement of autistic people in both its design and delivery. Findings: Participants on the autism spectrum found their mentoring experience very helpful in enabling them to progress towards self-identified goals, and mentees felt empowered by the person-centred ethos and the methods employed on the project. However, a number of aspects of the mentoring project have been identified that require further investigation, including: caution over offering mentoring without formal structures, boundary setting, supervision, flexibility and the matching of mentees with mentors. Originality/value: The project has highlighted the potential benefits of time-limited goal-orientated mentoring and the negligible evidence base underpinning current mentoring practice with adults on the autism spectrum. In order for the project to realise its emancipatory aim, there is a need for a large-scale quantitative study and a health-economics analysis to provide the necessary evidence base for mentoring to be recommended as a cost-effective intervention with clear benefits for individual wellbeing. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",0.38493723849372385

Some investigators explained this phenomenon in terms of a self-enhancement bias. The present study complements this motivational explanation with the parsimonious cognitive explanation that the phrase ""average ability"" may be interpreted as below-median ability rather than median ability. We believe people tend to construe an ""average"" target that is based on the most representative exemplar, and this result in different levels of ""average"" in different domains. Participants compared their abilities to those of an average person, typical person, and a person whose abilities are at the 40th, 50th, or 60th percentile. We found that participants' interpretation of ""average"" ability depended on the perceived difficulty of the ability. For abilities perceived as easy (e.g., spoken and written expression), participants construed an ""average"" target at the 40th percentile (i.e., below-median ability) and showed a marked better-than-average effect. On the contrary, for abilities perceived to be difficult, participants construed an ""average"" target at the median or even above the median. © 2017 Kim, Kwon and Chiu.",0.4371584699453552

Power laws are well documented in nature in general, particularly in the brain. Some previous fMRI studies have demonstrated a lower PLE during cognitive-task-evoked activity than during resting state activity. However, PLE modulation during cognitive-task-evoked activity and its relationship with an associated behavior remain unclear. In this functional fMRI study in the resting state and face processing + control task, we investigated PLE during both the resting state and task-evoked activities, as well as its relationship with behavior measured using mean reaction time (mRT) during the task. We found that (1) face discrimination-induced BOLD signal changes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), amygdala, and fusiform face area; (2) PLE significantly decreased during task-evoked activity specifically in mPFC compared with resting state activity; (3) most importantly, in mPFC, mRT significantly negatively correlated with both resting state PLE and the resting-task PLE difference.

Objective: In this study, we analyzed the correlation between urine AD-associated NTP (AD7c-NTP) level, and amyloid- (A-) deposition, and clinical symptoms in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Twenty-two patients with mild to moderate AD and 8 subjects with MCI were recruited. Aβ deposition was measured with [11C]-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET) in all participants. Urine AD7c-NTP levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were used to evaluate cognitive function and behavioral psychological symptoms, respectively. Results: Fourteen (63.6%) ofADpatients and 2 (25.0%) ofMCIsubjects wereA-positive on PiB-PET. Therewas a significant difference in urine AD7c-NTP level between -Aor1β positive (2.27±2.22 ng/ml) and negative (0.55±0.60 ng/ml) subjects (p = 0.018).

Methods This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study consisted of a single dose part and a multiple dose (3 times weekly for 4 weeks) part. Major inclusion criteria were hemodialysis for at least 90 days, serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) ≥ 300 pg/ml, and serum albumin-corrected Ca (cCa) ≥ 9.0 mg/dl. There were 3 single-dose cohorts (n = 6 each) randomized 2:1 to 5, 10, or 20 mg etelcalcetide or placebo, and 2 multiple-dose cohorts (n = 11 each) randomized 8:3 to 2.5 or 5 mg etelcalcetide or placebo. Results Etelcalcetide plasma concentration decreased rapidly after i.v. administration, generally remained stable from 24 hours postdose to the next dialysis, and then decreased by dialysis. Etelcalcetide exposure increased dose proportionally. Etelcalcetide plasma predialysis concentration reached almost steady state at week 4. A single dose of etelcalcetide dose-dependently reduced serum iPTH in 30 minutes, and the reduction reached a plateau at 1 hour that lasted until 8 hours. The percent change from baseline serum iPTH thereafter showed a trend to gradually decrease; it was still −30% or greater on day 3. Similar results were obtained at the last injection (days 27–29) of the multiple dose. The effect of the multiple dose was sustained during the interdialytic period. Etelcalcetide decreased serum cCa in a more gradual but dose-dependent and sustained manner. Discussion Etelcalcetide dose-dependently reduced serum iPTH and serum cCa. Moreover, the effect was sustained in the interdialytic period. © 2017 International Society of Nephrology",0.37916666666666665

DNA polymerase kappa protects human cells against MMC-induced genotoxicity through error-free translesion DNA synthesis,2017,12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031935658&doi=10.1186%2fs41021-016-0067-3&partnerID=40&md5=25cf6f078ef22f88a688f16f7ad2018e,"Background: Interactions between genes and environment are critical factors for causing cancer in humans. The genotoxicity of environmental chemicals can be enhanced via the modulation of susceptible genes in host human cells. DNA polymerase kappa (Pol κ) is a specialized DNA polymerase that plays an important role in DNA damage tolerance through translesion DNA synthesis. To better understand the protective roles of Pol κ, we previously engineered two human cell lines either deficient in expression of Pol κ (KO) or expressing catalytically dead Pol κ (CD) in Nalm-6-MSH+ cells and examined cytotoxic sensitivity against various genotoxins. In this study, we set up several genotoxicity assays with cell lines possessing altered Pol κ activities and investigated the protective roles of Pol κ in terms of genotoxicity induced by mitomycin C (MMC), a therapeutic agent that induces bulky DNA adduct and crosslinks in DNA. Results: We introduced a frameshift mutation in one allele of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of the KO, CD, and wild-type Pol κ cells (WT), thereby establishing cell lines for the TK gene mutation assay, namely TK+/- cells. In addition, we formulated experimental conditions to conduct chromosome aberration (CA) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assays with cells. By using the WT TK+/- and KO TK+/- cells, we assayed genotoxicity of MMC. In the TK gene mutation assay, the cytotoxic and mutagenic sensitivities of KO TK+/- cells were higher than those of WT TK+/- cells. MMC induced loss of heterozygosity (LOH), base pair substitutions at CpG sites and tandem mutations at GpG sites in both cell lines. However, the frequencies of LOH and base substitutions at CpG sites were significantly higher in KO TK+/-cells than in WT TK+/- cells. MMC also induced CA and SCE in both cell lines. The KO TK+/- cells displayed higher sensitivity than that displayed by WT TK+/- cells in the SCE assay. Conclusions: These results suggest that Pol κ is a modulating factor for the genotoxicity of MMC and also that the established cell lines are useful for evaluating the genotoxicity of chemicals from multiple endpoints in different genetic backgrounds of Pol κ. © 2017 The Author(s).

Thirty-two university students were asked to read a leaflet about a certain confection brand (target product, either baked cake or chocolate) with or without tasting a sample (n = 16 each). They then performed a category classification task in which 12 colored pictures of different confection brand packages (six baked cakes and six chocolates) were presented one by one in a random order. The participants’ task was to press a button whenever the pictures of the designated confection category (i.e., the category other than the category of the target product) appeared on the screen. ERP responses to the target brand and the other five brands in the same category were compared. The results showed that the specific effect of sampling appeared only from about 500 ms. The target brand elicited a larger late positive potential (LPP) than the other brands only for the participants who sampled it. The findings suggest that, compared with merely reading the information about a product, tasting a sample makes the brand more motivationally salient than the other brands in the same food category.. © 2017 Psychologia Society.

Heterogeneous Association of Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Amyloid-β and Amyloid-β Protein Precursor with Synapses,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029611149&doi=10.3233%2fJAD-170262&partnerID=40&md5=809e48c0233262ad4d916237c2c3a7ac,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly viewed as a disease of synapses. Loss of synapses correlates better with cognitive decline than amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the hallmark neuropathological lesions of AD. Soluble forms of amyloid-β (Aβ) have emerged as mediators of synapse dysfunction. Aβ binds to, accumulates, and aggregates in synapses. However, the anatomical and neurotransmitter specificity of Aβ and the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) in AD remain poorly understood. In addition, the relative roles of Aβ and AβPP in the development of AD, at pre- versus post-synaptic compartments and axons versus dendrites, respectively, remain unclear. Here we use immunogold electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to provide evidence for heterogeneity in the localization of Aβ/AβPP. We demonstrate that Aβ binds to a subset of synapses in cultured neurons, with preferential binding to glutamatergic compared to GABAergic neurons. We also highlight the challenge of defining pre- versus post-synaptic localization of this binding by confocal microscopy. Further, endogenous Aβ42 accumulates in both glutamatergic and GABAergic AβPP/PS1 transgenic primary neurons, but at varying levels. Moreover, upon knock-out of presenilin 1 or inhibition of γ-secretase AβPP C-terminal fragments accumulate both pre- and post-synaptically; however earlier pre-synaptically, consistent with a higher rate of AβPP processing in axons. A better understanding of the synaptic and anatomical selectivity of Aβ/AβPP in AD can be important for the development of more effective new therapies for this major disease of aging. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Gesture Decoding Using ECoG Signals from Human Sensorimotor Cortex: A Pilot Study,2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029693002&doi=10.1155%2f2017%2f3435686&partnerID=40&md5=f3e145ed3f4556a79d9ed83747316d2c,"Electrocorticography (ECoG) has been demonstrated as a promising neural signal source for developing brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). However, many concerns about the disadvantages brought by large craniotomy for implanting the ECoG grid limit the clinical translation of ECoG-based BMIs. In this study, we collected clinical ECoG signals from the sensorimotor cortex of three epileptic participants when they performed hand gestures. The ECoG power spectrum in hybrid frequency bands was extracted to build a synchronous real-time BMI system. High decoding accuracy of the three gestures was achieved in both offline analysis (85.7%, 84.5%, and 69.7%) and online tests (80% and 82%, tested on two participants only). We found that the decoding performance was maintained even with a subset of channels selected by a greedy algorithm. More importantly, these selected channels were mostly distributed along the central sulcus and clustered in the area of 3 interelectrode squares. Our findings of the reduced and clustered distribution of ECoG channels further supported the feasibility of clinically implementing the ECoG-based BMI system for the control of hand gestures. © 2017 Yue Li et al.",0.4
Emotion and attention: When the heart's eye guides the mind's eye,2017,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027096659&doi=10.17791%2fjcs.2017.18.2.103&partnerID=40&md5=73fada7746cd70a1e1cc79c55b3ed816,"The dichotomy between ""cold"" cognition and ""hot"" emotion is deeply rooted in our understanding of the human mind. Traditional research in cognitive science often ignores the role of emotion when pursuing an information processing model. Recently, however, research has supported the critical role of emotion in many cognitive processes, including attention, memory, and decision-making. The interaction between attention and emotion is especially important in the adaptive sense because the ability to quickly respond to meaningful stimuli is essential for survival. The current review uses the distinction between top-down (goal-directed) and bottom-up (stimulus-driven) attention to investigate the relationship between emotion and attention. In particular, this review focuses on the relationship among visual selective attention and affective states, individual differences of emotional processing, and neural bases for the interaction between emotion and attention. Converging evidence shows that emotion can prioritize stimuli in the environment and that attention plays a role in controlling emotional processing.",0.4276315789473684

Pressing a key by one member of each pair of eight undergraduates produced points on a multiple fixed-interval (FI) FI schedule. Another member of the pair was exposed to a multiple fixed-ratio (FR) differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) schedule. After every session, verbal descriptions of how to increase points written by another member of the pair were presented. The final response rates under the multiple FI FI schedule were indistinguishable between the two components in each of four participants although they each received verbal descriptions indicating that the way to increase points with the key was to respond rapidly in one component and to respond slowly in another. Such weak effects of instructions given from persons other than the experimenter were contrasted with stronger effects of instructions given by the experimenter, that is, the final response rates were higher with the instruction to respond rapidly than with the instruction to respond slowly for three of the four participants. This differential effect across the instruction providers was not found in each of four participants who were exposed to the multiple FR DRL schedule. © 2017, Sociedad Mexicana de Analisis de la Conducta.

The new work engagement items were tested to assess their psychometrics. Their integrity was tested via exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, which retained 18 items for a three-component model having satisfactory fit indexes with three 6-item subscales named Cognitive, Emotional, and Physical Work Engagement. The reliabilities and validities of the new scales were also empirically tested, with reliabilities ranging from.78 to.91; and correlation tests yielded statistical support for the convergent, divergent, and concurrent validities of the new measure. The scales were also tested for application to organizations, with Self-Efficacy as a positive predictor that explained 10% to 16% of the variance for all three work engagement measures. Also, the three work engagement scales were all negative predictors of, and, together, explained 12% of the variance for Turnover Intention.

Interestingly, work volition mediated the link between perceiving a calling and both job- and life satisfaction. Inconsistent with previous research suggesting that work volition was an antecedent of living a calling, this study showed that work volition directly linked to job and life satisfaction. Furthermore, the mediating effects of work volition were stronger than living a calling for job-and life satisfaction among South Koreans.

This paper provides a novel approach to youth identity in an Eastern European post-communist context for minority groups that are quite distinct from the mainstream group to advance the study of identity. Turkish-Bulgarians and Muslim-Bulgarians have been subjected to extensive assimilation campaigns, which prompted them to carefully negotiate their ethnic identity and sense of belonging. participants and procedure Participants were 366 adolescents aged 16 to 18 years (M = 16.72, SD = 0.71) from South Central and South Western regions of Bulgaria. This sample included Turkish-Bulgarian (n = 145), Muslim-Bulgarian (n = 85), and (mainstream) Bulgarian (n = 136) youth who provided data on personal, ethnic, familial, and religious identity as well as psychological well-being. results Turkish-Bulgarian youth scored higher on achievement, diffusion, and foreclosure but lower on moratorium and Bulgarian ethnic and familial identity than Muslim-Bulgarian and Bulgarian youth. Bulgarian mainstreamers scored significantly lower on religious identity compared to their Turkish-Bulgarian and Muslim-Bulgarian peers. Finally, Bulgarian mainstream identity significantly predicted well-being of youth from all groups, independent of their ethnic background. conclusions A strong ethnic and familial identity results in beneficial psychological outcomes for youth, even in the face of adversity and assimilation. © 2016 Current Issues in Personality Psychology.",0.4722222222222222

We used a computer-based battery of spatial navigation tests to measure the SN performance in 22 MCI patients as well as 21 normal controls (NC). In order to evaluate intrinsic activity in the subcortical regions that may play a role in SN, we measured ALFF, fALFF, and ReHo derived within 14 subcortical regions. We observed reductions of intrinsic activity in MCI patients. We also demonstrated that the MCI versus NC group difference can modulate activity-behavior relationship, that is, the correlation slopes between ReHo and allocentric SN task total errors were significantly different between NC and MCI groups in the right hippocampus (interaction F=4.44, p=0.05), pallidum (F=8.97, p=0.005), and thalamus (F=5.95, p=0.02), which were negative in NC (right hippocampus, r=-0.49; right pallidum, r=-0.50; right thalamus, r=-0.45; all p<0.05) but absent in MCI (right hippocampus, r=0.21; right pallidum, r=0.32; right thalamus r=0.28; all p>0.2). These findings may provide a novel insight of the brain mechanism associated with SN impairment in MCI and indicated a stage specificity of brain-behavior correlation in dementia.

Multiple factors are responsible for breast cancer and heritable factors have received much attention. DNA damage in breast cancer is induced by prolonged exposure to estrogens, such as 17β-estradiol, daily social/ psychological stressors, and environmental chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs). DNA damage induced by estrogen and stress is an important factor in the pathogenesis and development of breast cancer and is now recognized as a critical provision for chemoprevention of breast cancer.

Comparative Analysis of Cortical Microinfarcts and Microbleeds using 3.0-Tesla Postmortem Magnetic Resonance Images and Histopathology,2017,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026835172&doi=10.3233%2fJAD-161242&partnerID=40&md5=242297bb1007639b3c3d1e0b5c46b7f4,"Microvascular lesions including cortical microinfarctions (CMIs) and cerebral lobar microbleeds (CMBs) are usually caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in the elderly and are correlated with cognitive decline. However, their radiological-histopathological coincidence has not been revealed systematically with widely used 3-Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The purpose of the present study is to delineate the histopathological background corresponding to MR images of these lesions. We examined formalin-fixed 10-mm thick coronal brain blocks from 10 CAA patients (five were also diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, three with dementia with Lewy bodies, and two with CAA only) with dementia and six non CAA patients with neurodegenerative disease. Using 3T MRI, both 3D-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and 3D-double inversion recovery (DIR) were examined to identify CMIs, and T2∗ and susceptibility-weighted images (SWI) were examined to identify CMBs. These blocks were subsequently examined histologically and immunohistochemically. In CAA patients, 48 CMIs and 6 lobar CMBs were invariably observed in close proximity to degenerated Aβ-positive blood vessels. Moreover, 16 CMIs (33) of 48 were detected with postmortem MRI, but none were seen when the lesion size was smaller than 1 mm. In contrast, only 1 undeniable CMI was founded with MRI and histopathology in 6 non CAA patients. Small, cortical high-intensity lesions seen on 3D-FLAIR and 3D-DIR images likely represent CMIs, and low-intensity lesions in T2∗ and SWI correspond to CMBs with in vivo MRI. Furthermore, a close association between amyloid-laden vessels and these microvascular lesions indicated the contribution of CAA to their pathogenesis. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 847 students aged 12–21 years from Lhasa, Tibet, during September and October 2015 with a participation rate of 97.7%. The Tibetan translation of self-completed s-EMBU was administered. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to test the scale’s validity on the first half of the sample and was then cross-validated with the second half of the sample. The final model consisted of six factors: three (rejection, emotional warmth, and overprotection) for each parent, equality constrained on factor loadings, factor correlations, and error variance between father and mother. Father–mother correlation coefficients ranged from 0.81 to 0.86, and the level of consistency ranged from 0.62 to 0.82. Thus, the slightly modified s-EMBU is suitable for use in the Tibetan culture where both the father and the mother have consistent parenting styles. © 2017 Yangzong et al.",0.3969849246231156

How are they organized, and to what extent do they predict consequential outcomes? Separate theoretical traditions have suggested interpersonal, intrapersonal, and intellectual dimensions, reflecting how children relate to other people, manage their own goals and impulses, and engage with ideas, respectively. However, very little work has examined character empirically. In the current investigation, we partnered with middle schools that had previously identified character strengths relevant in their communities. Across three longitudinal, prospective studies, we examined the factor structure of character, associations with intelligence and Big Five personality traits, and predictive validity for consequential outcomes like peer relations, class participation, and report card grades. In Study 1, teachers rated their students on behaviors exemplifying character strengths as they played out in students’ daily lives. Exploratory factor analyses yielded a three-factor structure consisting of interpersonal (interpersonal self-control, gratitude, social intelligence), intellectual (zest, curiosity), and intrapersonal (academic self-control, grit) factors of character. In Study 2, children rated their own behavior and completed a test of cognitive ability. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the same three-factor structure, and these factors were only weakly associated with cognitive ability. In Study 3, teachers provided character ratings; in parallel, students completed measures of character as well as Big Five personality factors. As expected, intellectual, interpersonal, and intrapersonal character factors related to Big Five openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, respectively. Across studies, positive peer relations were most consistently predicted by interpersonal character, class participation by intellectual character, and report card grades by intrapersonal character. Collectively, our findings support a tripartite taxonomy of character in the school context. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.5539033457249071

This ratio has been related to prenatal testosterone concentrations and addictive behaviors including problematic video-gaming. We aimed to investigate the possible association between 2D:4D ratios and Internet addiction and whether such a relationship would be independent of impulsivity. Methods: A total of 652 university students (369 women, 283 men), aged 17-27 years, were enrolled in the study. Problematic and pathological Internet use (PPIU) was assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). The participants also completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (version 11; BIS-11) and had their 2D:4D ratios measured. Results: 2D:4D ratios were not significantly different in women with PPIU and in those with adaptive Internet use (AIU). Men with PPIU exhibited lower 2D:4D ratios on both hands when compared with those with AIU. Correlation analysis revealed that 2D:4D ratios on both hands were negatively correlated with IAT scores among men, but not among women. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age, duration of weekly Internet use, impulsiveness, and 2D:4D ratios on the right hand were independently associated with IAT scores among men, and impulsivity did not mediate the relationship between 2D:4D ratios and PPIU. Conclusions: For men, 2D:4D ratios on the right hand were inversely correlated with Internet addiction severity even after controlling for individual differences in impulsivity. These findings suggest that high prenatal testosterone levels may contribute to the occurrence of PPIU among men. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.388
People are more generous to a partner who pays attention to them,2017,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014173962&doi=10.1177%2f1474704916687310&partnerID=40&md5=b8e523ee33386ae04baa289b7e660cc7,"People use relatively low-cost signals to maintain close relationships, in which they engage in costlier exchanges of tangible support. Paying attention to a partner allows an individual to communicate his or her interest in the relationship with the partner. Previous studies have revealed that when Person A pays attention to Person B, B's feeling of intimacy toward A increases. If social attention strengthens the bond between A and B, it is predicted that A's attention will also increase B's generous behavior toward A. This study tested this prediction. Participants first engaged in a collaborative task using computers. In the task, the putative partner (a computer program) either paid or did not pay attention to participants (high attention condition vs. low attention condition). In the control condition, the partner could not choose when to pay attention to participants. They then played three rounds of the dictator game with the partner. Confirming the previous finding, perceived intimacy was highest in the high attention condition, in the middle in the control condition, and lowest in the low attention condition. More importantly, participants in the high attention condition decided to give more resources to their partner than those in the low attention condition (but the difference between the high attention condition and the control condition was not significant). In addition, self-reported intimacy was positively correlated with the resource allocated to the partner. The results of this study demonstrated that social attention fosters a partner's generosity. © The Author(s) 2017.",0.4691358024691358
Advancing the Bayesian Approach for Multidimensional Polytomous and Nominal IRT Models: Model Formulations and Fit Measures,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85002412760&doi=10.1177%2f0146621616669096&partnerID=40&md5=096904d5acb8a014f02c4e5d77340207,"It is common to encounter polytomous and nominal responses with latent variables in social or behavior research, and a variety of polytomous and nominal item response theory (IRT) models are available for applied researchers across diverse settings. With its flexibility and scalability, the Bayesian approach using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method demonstrates its great advantages for polytomous and nominal IRT models. However, the potential of the Bayesian approach would not be fully realized without model formulations that can cover various models and effective fit measures for model assessment or criticism. This research first provided formulations for typical models that are representative of different modeling groups. Then, a series of discrepancy measures that can offer diagnostic information for model-data misfit were introduced. Simulation studies showed that the formulation worked as expected, and some of the fit measures were more useful than the others or across different situations. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",0.5
Reciprocal relationship between internet addiction and network-related maladaptive cognition among Chinese college freshmen: A longitudinal cross-lagged analysis,2017,16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021202853&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01047&partnerID=40&md5=224e9ef014273404aaad0d726ed2bbb2,"This study explored the reciprocal relationship between Internet addiction (IA) and network-related maladaptive cognition (NMC) in Chinese college freshmen. A short-term longitudinal survey with a sample of 213 college freshmen was conducted in Shandong province, China. The results revealed that IA can significantly predict the generation and development of NMCs, and that when such maladaptive cognitions have been established, they can further adversely affect the extent of the students' IA. A vicious cycle was observed between these two variables, with IA having predictive priority in its relationship with NMC. This study also determined that the relationship between these two variables was the same for both males and females; therefore, the final model we established can be extensively applied to Chinese college freshmen, regardless of gender. Understanding the reciprocal relationship between these two variables can assist in interventions in IA at the outset of students' college life. © 2017 Han, Wang, Lin, Tian, Gao and Chen.",0.42105263157894735

Our objective was to apply well-known CSF biomarkers and redetermine their diagnostic cutoff values for AD in South Korea. CSF samples from matched control subjects (n71), patients with AD dementia (ADD, n76), and other neurological disorders with cognitive decline (OND, n47) were obtained from 6 Korean dementia clinics according to a standardized protocol. CSF biomarker concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CSF biomarkers differed significantly between the ADD and control groups (P<0.001 for all), and between the ADD and OND groups (P<0.001 for all). The areas under the curve in differentiation of ADD from control subjects were 0.97 for Aβ42, 0.93 for total tau (tTau), 0.86 for pTau, and 0.99 for both tTauAβ42 and pTauAβ42 ratios. Our revised cutoff value for Aβ42 was higher than our previous one, whereas the values for the Tau proteins were similar. The tTauAβ42 ratio had the highest accuracy, 97. Our findings highlight the usefulness of CSF AD biomarkers in South Korea, and the necessity of continually testing the reliability of cutoff values. © 2016 The Author(s).",0.4606741573033708
Negative perception of socioeconomic status with depressive mood down-regulates expression of PPBP and SLC1A7 genes in peripheral blood leukocytes,2017,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020553978&doi=10.1080%2f23311908.2017.1338825&partnerID=40&md5=08769f1c192ddede51d919e2a197623f,"Inequality in socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with an increased risk for the development of mental health problems. Here, we examined the association between socioeconomic status (SSS) and psychological distress, and measured gene expression signatures in peripheral blood leukocytes responsible for this association, in 129 healthy adults (27 males and 102 females, aged 44.0 ± 13.0 years) working in a private hospital in Japan. Depressive mood was assessed by Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). A multiple regression analysis adjusted for gender and age showed that subjective SSS was independently and negatively associated with SDS score. We next focused on 9 subjects who exhibited low SSS scores and 11 subjects with high SSS scores. Microarray analysis revealed that levels of 522 mRNAs were differentially expressed in periheral leukocytes between low and high-SSS groups. The differentially expressed genes were preferentially involved in cellular movement or inflammatory responses. Among them, mRNA levels of pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) and solute carrier family 1 (glutamine transporter), member 7 (SLC1A7) were negatively correlated with SSS scores. Our results re-confirmed the association between negative perception of SES and depressive mood in healthy adults, and suggest a possible involvement of PPBP and SLC1A7 in the association. © 2017 The Author(s).

Prolonged interruption of cognitive control of conflict processing over human faces by task-irrelevant emotion expression,2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020903666&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01024&partnerID=40&md5=7cf8d40e054b940ab7d7f857f3474560,"As documented by Darwin 150 years ago, emotion expressed in human faces readily draws our attention and promotes sympathetic emotional reactions. How do such reactions to the expression of emotion affect our goal-directed actions? Despite the substantial advance made in the neural mechanisms of both cognitive control and emotional processing, it is not yet known well how these two systems interact. Here, we studied how emotion expressed in human faces influences cognitive control of conflict processing, spatial selective attention and inhibitory control in particular, using the Eriksen flanker paradigm. In this task, participants viewed displays of a central target face flanked by peripheral faces and were asked to judge the gender of the target face; task-irrelevant emotion expressions were embedded in the target face, the flanking faces, or both. We also monitored how emotion expression affects gender judgment performance while varying the relative timing between the target and flanker faces. As previously reported, we found robust gender congruency effects, namely slower responses to the target faces whose gender was incongruent with that of the flanker faces, when the flankers preceded the target by 0.1 s. When the flankers further advanced the target by 0.3 s, however, the congruency effect vanished in most of the viewing conditions, except for when emotion was expressed only in the flanking faces or when congruent emotion was expressed in the target and flanking faces. These results suggest that emotional saliency can prolong a substantial degree of conflict by diverting bottom-up attention away from the target, and that inhibitory control on task-irrelevant information from flanking stimuli is deterred by the emotional congruency between target and flanking stimuli. © 2017 Kim, Kang, Cho and Lee.",0.45787545787545786

This study aimed to investigate these variables and examine the relations among them. Three structural equation models tested the multiple mediational roles of self-efficacy, intrinsic value, and boredom in the relation between teacher's autonomy support and behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, respectively, in math. A total of 637 Chinese middle school students (313 males, 324 females; mean age = 14.82) voluntarily participated in this study. Results revealed that self-efficacy, intrinsic value, and boredom played important and mediating roles between perceived teacher's autonomy support and student engagement. Specifically, these three individual variables partly mediated the relations between perceived teacher's autonomy support and behavioral and cognitive engagement, while fully mediating the relation between perceived teacher's autonomy support and emotional engagement. These findings complement and extend the understanding of factors affecting students' engagement in math. © 2017 Wang, Liu, Ding, Xu, Liu and Zhen.",0.5732484076433121

It was found, with regard to word length variables, that the number of syllables and the number of visual features affected reading times significantly, but the other sub-lexical units (i.e., phonemes and letters) did not. The findings suggest that when taking internal structure variations into account, the relevant processing unit in Korean in the context of sentence is the syllable. In addition, the main effects of both word frequency and predictability on reading time were significant, respectively; however, the interaction between these two variables was not. The results imply that Korean word recognition during sentence reading is affected by word frequency and word predictability, additively. © 2017.

Interparental conflict relative to suicidal ideation in Chinese adolescents: The roles of coping strategies and meaning in life,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021209648&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01010&partnerID=40&md5=04917779a1c04cb3923754fc9e85930b,"The aim of this study was to explore the paths between interparental conflict and Chinese adolescents' suicidal ideation. Altogether 931 adolescents (Mage = 17.84, SD = 0.77, females = 531) completed the Dyadic Consensus Scale, Self-Report Coping Scale, Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation questionnaires. Mediation analyses were conducted, focusing on the relations between interparental conflict and suicidal ideation along with coping styles and a sense of meaning in life. The results showed that interparental conflict indirectly predicted adolescents' suicidal ideation via three mediators: coping-approach strategies, presence of meaning, and the joint serial effects of coping-approach strategies and presence of meaning in Chinese adolescents. In addition, boys were more likely to be at risk for suicidal ideation than girls, so were 10th graders compared to 11th graders. These findings supported a combined distress-to-meaninglessness line of thinking along with the use of coping-approach strategies to depress self-harm ideation. Generally, interparental conflict should be kept out of youngsters' immediate vicinity as a preventive measure of suicidal ideation. © 2017 Zhang, Li, Chen, Ewalds-Kvist and Liu.",0.44642857142857145

Computational intelligent hybrid model for detecting disruptive trading activity,2017,13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994429970&doi=10.1016%2fj.dss.2016.09.003&partnerID=40&md5=72ec14d67e369e71d1cd57a45820631e,"The term “disruptive trading behaviour” was first proposed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is now widely used by US and EU regulation (MiFID II) to describe activities that create a misleading appearance of market liquidity or depth or an artificial price movement upward or downward according to their own purposes. Such activities, identified as a new form of financial fraud in EU regulations, damage the proper functioning and integrity of capital markets and are hence extremely harmful. While existing studies have explored this issue, they have, in most cases, either focused on empirical analysis of such cases or proposed detection models based on certain assumptions of the market. Effective methods that can analyse and detect such disruptive activities based on direct studies of trading behaviours have not been studied to date. There exists, accordingly, a knowledge gap in the literature. This paper seeks to address that gap and provides a hybrid model composed of two data-mining-based detection modules that effectively identify disruptive trading behaviours. The hybrid model is designed to work in an on-line scheme. The limit order stream is transformed, calculated and extracted as a feature stream. One detection module, “Single Order Detection,” detects disruptive behaviours by identifying abnormal patterns of every single trading order. Another module, “Order Sequence Detection,” approaches the problem by examining the contextual relationships of a sequence of trading orders using an extended hidden Markov model, which identifies whether sequential changes from the extracted features are manipulative activities (or not). Both models were evaluated using huge volumes of real tick data from the NASDAQ, which demonstrated that both are able to identify a range of disruptive trading behaviours and, furthermore, that they outperform the selected traditional benchmark models. Thus, this hybrid model is shown to make a substantial contribution to the literature on financial market surveillance and to offer a practical and effective approach for the identification of disruptive trading behaviour. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",0.46417445482866043
Perceptions of food intake and weight status among parents of picky eating infants and toddlers in China: A cross-sectional study,2017,29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995478945&doi=10.1016%2fj.appet.2016.11.009&partnerID=40&md5=1b896a07fab98b280a5e3ddbe767b4f5,"Background Previous studies have suggested that children that are picky eaters may have a different and less varied diet than non-picky children, but the literature on picky eating in Chinese children is limited. Objectives To assess the prevalence of picky eating in 6–35 month-old Chinese children, and to explore how parents' perceptions of picky eating relate to children's intake and body composition. Methods 1414 6-35 month-old infants and toddlers from 8 Chinese cities were included in this study. Questionnaires were used to collect information on family demographic factors, child picky eating behaviors, food group rejection, and parents' perception of child weight status. Dietary intake data was collected via 24-h recall. Children's length/height and weight were measured. Results The reported prevalence of picky eating was higher in 24–35 month-olds (36% of children) compared to 6-11 month-olds (12%). There were no consistent significant differences in dietary intakes of nutrients between picky and non-picky eaters. Picky eating children whose parents indicated that they avoided eggs had lower intake of this food group compared to non-picky eaters, whereas those reported to avoid grains or meat had higher intakes of those food groups. Weight status was underestimated by parents of both picky and non-picky children. Conclusions Picky eating seems to occur at similar prevalence rates in China as has been reported in other countries. Parents' perceptions of food refusal do not reflect actual intakes, nor do nutrient intakes of picky eaters show additional gaps compared to non-picky eating children. In healthy children with typical growth patterns, picky eating seems to be a normal phase of development experienced by some children, without substantial consequences on their nutrient or food group intakes. © 2016 The Author(s)",0.35687732342007433

Since Brown and Levinson (1993), several studies have shown that speakers of Mesoamerican languages largely prefer non-egocentric strategies in the solution of nonverbal tasks and that this preference strongly aligns to the spatial expressions found in these languages. Moreover, it has been argued that contact with Spanish increases the use of egocentric responses. This paper engages in this discussion with new evidence from a Mexican community which has shifted from a Mesoamerican language, Ixcatec, to Spanish during the twentieth century. It presents three studies consisting of nonverbal, memorization tasks, conducted with a total of 52 monolingual Spanish speakers from the community of Santa María Ixcatlán. According to the neo-Whorfian approach, the residents of Santa María Ixcatlán should strongly favour the Spanish-related egocentric responses. Against this assumption, however, our study shows that the geocentric responses are predominant among the Ixcatecs. This result clearly indicates that frames of reference are culturally-defined and do not disappear in case of language shift but persist in cognitive representations among the members of a stable, rural community. © 2017 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",0.36231884057971014

Thus, important questions are how Chinese urban consumers perceive organic food, and what are the main concepts associated to the organic attribute. We aimed at representing in graphic form the network of mental associations with the organic concept. We used an adapted version of the “Brand concept mapping” method to acquire, process, and draw individual concept networks perceived by 50 organic food consumers in Shanghai. We then analyzed the data using network and cluster analysis to create aggregated maps for two distinct groups of consumers. Similarly to their peers in developed countries, Chinese consumers perceive organic food as healthy, safe and expensive. However, organic is not necessarily synonymous with natural produce in China, also due to a translation of the term that conveys the idea of a “technology advanced” product. Organic overlaps with the green food label in terms of image and positioning in the market, since they are easily associated and often confused. The two groups we identified show clear differences in the way the organic concept is associated to other concepts and features. The study provides useful information for practitioners: marketers of organic products in China should invest in communication to emphasize the differences with Green Food products and they should consider the possibility of segmenting organic consumers; Chinese policy makers should consider implementing information campaigns aimed at achieving a better understanding of the features of these quality labels among consumers. For researchers, the study confirms that the BCM method is effective and its integration with network and cluster analysis improves the interpretation of individual and aggregated maps. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0.5

The research collected 740 news article titles that featured disabled sports published from January 2010 to December 2015 and available from a database of news articles in Korea. The Krkwic, a computer program for the analysis of Korean text, was used to extract Korean keywords, and 1,961 value-related texts were extracted from the news articles. Texts whose frequency of co-occurrence was five times or higher in the text × text matrix were selected, followed by network analysis to obtain the value-related texts on disabled sports. Degree, between, and eigenvector centralities on the text network were calculated using Netminer 4.0. The three core texts related to the value of disabled sports in Korean news articles were “festival,” “challenge,” and “dream.” These three core texts had associated texts that had positive and negative connotations. Korean news articles assigned disabled sports the value of the celebration of persons with disabilities, the objective to face challenges, and the dream of overcoming disabilities. © 2017 The Author(s).

To analyze the effect of galantamine on BPSD and caregiver burden, we treated a total of 50 patients with mild AD for 12 weeks and evaluated them using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Japanese version of the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI). We also performed regional cerebral blood flow single photon emission computed tomography (rCBF SPECT) at baseline using three-dimensional sterotatic surface projections. Total NPI and ZBI scores did not significantly change after 12-week galantamine treatment. To identify the characteristics of patients who showed improvement after galantamine treatment, we divided patients into two groups, those with and those without sub-items on the NPI. Patients with aggression showed improvement in ZBI scores (p < 0.05). A comparison of rCBF SPECT between these two groups indicated that patients with aggression exhibited increased rCBF in the right prefrontal cortex compared with those without aggression. In a patient with aggression, 20-month treatment with galantamine inhibited increases in the rCBF area in the right prefrontal lobe. These results suggest that galantamine response may be related to aggression and dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",0.4251207729468599

They identity the consciousness of equality, but their awareness of fighting for rights is not strong. They have a sense of freedom, but some students are not clear about the relationship between freedom and law. Their enthusiasm to participate in public affairs is not high. Their awareness of social morality is not comprehensive. The reason is that the influence of traditional culture and the political development can’t keep up with the development of economy and the systematic citizenship education is lacked. Finally, we put forward a method of improve the civic awareness of Contemporary College Students in this paper. © 2017 IJCRSEE. All Right Reserved.",0.4161490683229814
"The correlation among neural dynamic processing of conflict control, testosterone and cortisol levels in 10-year-old children",2017,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021210090&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01037&partnerID=40&md5=7db0e4999195d1cacb93b68343f4fe0a,"Cognitive control is related to goal-directed self-regulation abilities, which is fundamental for human development. Conflict control includes the neural processes of conflict monitoring and conflict resolution. Testosterone and cortisol are essential hormones for the development of cognitive functions. However, there are no studies that have investigated the correlation of these two hormones with conflict control in preadolescents. In this study, we aimed to explore whether testosterone, cortisol, and testosterone/cortisol ratio worked differently for preadolescent's conflict control processes in varied conflict control tasks. Thirty-two 10-year-old children (16 boys and 16 girls) were enrolled. They were instructed to accomplish three conflict control tasks with different conflict dimensions, including the Flanker, Simon, and Stroop tasks, and electrophysiological signals were recorded. Salivary samples were collected from each child. The testosterone and cortisol levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The electrophysiological results showed that the incongruent trials induced greater N2/N450 and P3/SP responses than the congruent trials during neural processes of conflict monitoring and conflict resolution in the Flanker and Stroop tasks. The hormonal findings showed that (1) the testosterone/cortisol ratio was correlated with conflict control accuracy and conflict resolution in the Flanker task; (2) the testosterone level was associated with conflict control performance and neural processing of conflict resolution in the Stroop task; (3) the cortisol level was correlated with conflict control performance and neural processing of conflict monitoring in the Simon task. In conclusion, in 10-year-old children, the fewer processes a task needs, the more likely there is an association between the T/C ratios and the behavioral and brain response, and the dual-hormone effects on conflict resolution may be testosterone-driven in the Stroop and Flanker tasks. © 2017 Shangguan, Liu, Liu and Shi.",0.45255474452554745

This paper discusses this shift from the perspective of design. We address these future topics by showing our views or opinions, as well as by referring to some theories and arguments that have appeared up to the present in this regard. Concretely, we postulate that the design process comprises the stages of intuition or gut feeling, followed by analysis or synthesis, finally leading to the design outcome. Assuming that one of the factors that determines design creativity is whether the purpose or goal of a design is inside or outside of the design process, we also examine the aspects of these conditions. We then suggest the idea of an Innovation Design process model composed of two cycles: analytical design creation and synthetic design creation. In the former, a design solution is explored to fulfill a purpose or goal pre-assigned to a product from outside, leading to quantitative innovation. In the latter, hypothesization starting with an intuition or gut feeling leads to the design of a breakthrough product, leading to qualitative innovation. Finally, we present an outline of the design school (workshop) conducted based on these thoughts. © 2017 The Author(s).

Besides PS, which has been widely believed to function as the catalytic subunit of the complex, the functional roles of the other subunits in the γ-secretase complex remain debatable. In the current study, we set out to determine the role of Pen-2 in γ-secretase activity. To this end, using knockout cells in combination with siRNA and immunoprecipitation approaches, our results revealed that Pen-2 together with presenilin are sufficient to form a functionally active enzyme to process Notch. Specifically, our data demonstrated that Pen-2 plays a crucial role in substrate binding, a mechanism by which Pen-2 contributes directly to the catalytic mechanism of γ-secretase activity. Our data also suggested that there may be different requirements for components to process AβPP and Notch. This information would be important for therapeutic strategy aimed at inhibition or modulation of γ-secretase activity.",0.38181818181818183

The orientations are represented as real values on a sentiment domain, which is derived from high-dimensional vector space for the movie reviews. To search for the dimension, the Point-wise Mutual Information is first used to select a set of words that are close to common modifiers; The phrases comprised of these words often form good/bad associations (e.g., ""good acting"", ""terrible acting""). A neural language model (Word2Vec) is then used to calculate the point-wise similarity distances between the chosen words and, dimensionality reduction algorithms (e.g., PCA, MDS) are employed to find the axis of the sentiment orientations. Finally, the performance of our method is measured by unsupervised classification of the two movie reviews based on the orientation values.

Two questionnaire surveys were conducted to collect data from randomly sampled residents in Japan (n = 382 and n = 1200), in order to compare behavioral and psychological factors as a function of sleepiness. Both surveys consistently indicated that respondents with low sleepiness were less pessimistic, and engaged in pro-environmental behaviors more frequently compared to those with high sleepiness, and that sleepiness is negatively associated with the O/P ratio and pro-environmental behaviors, implying that sleepiness might hinder pro-environmental behaviors in daily life.

Cyclophilin D Promotes Brain Mitochondrial F1FO ATP Synthase Dysfunction in Aging Mice,2017,54,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007251835&doi=10.3233%2fJAD-160822&partnerID=40&md5=69bcd9a5c3704b84976f5fa94885fcde,"Brain aging is the known strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, mitochondrial deficits have been proposed to be a common mechanism linking brain aging to AD. Therefore, to elucidate the causative mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging brains is of paramount importance for our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, in particular its sporadic form. Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a specific mitochondrial protein. Recent studies have shown that F1FO ATP synthase oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein (OSCP) is a binding partner of CypD. The interaction of CypD with OSCP modulates F1FO ATP synthase function and mediates mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Here, we have found that increased CypD expression, enhanced CypD/OSCP interaction, and selective loss of OSCP are prominent brain mitochondrial changes in aging mice. Along with these changes, brain mitochondria from the aging mice demonstrated decreased F1FO ATP synthase activity and defective F1FO complex coupling. In contrast, CypD deficient mice exhibited substantially mitigated brain mitochondrial F1FO ATP synthase dysfunction with relatively preserved mitochondrial function during aging. Interestingly, the aging-related OSCP loss was also dramatically attenuated by CypD depletion. Therefore, the simplest interpretation of this study is that CypD promotes F1FO ATP synthase dysfunction and the resultant mitochondrial deficits in aging brains. In addition, in view of CypD and F1FO ATP synthase alterations seen in AD brains, the results further suggest that CypD-mediated F1FO ATP synthase deregulation is a shared mechanism linking mitochondrial deficits in brain aging and AD. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

AIS plasticity has been reported to happen during normal development of neocortex and also in a few pathological conditions involving disruption of the inhibition/excitation balance. Here we report on the impact of early environmental interventions on structural plasticity of AIS in the mouse neocortex. C57BL/6 mice were raised in standard or enriched environment (EE) from birth up to the time of experiments and were injected with saline or MK-801 [N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, 1 mg/kg] on postnatal days (P) 6–10. We used Ankyrin G immunoreactivity to mark the AIS of cortical neurons in two sub-regions of frontal cortex (frontal association area, FrA and secondary motor cortex, M2) and in the secondary visual cortex (V2). In 1-month-old mice, the mean AIS length differed between three areas, with the shortest AISs being observed in V2. Postnatal MK-801 or EE led to shortening of AIS only in the frontal areas. However, exposure to EE restored AIS shortening induced by MK-801. Chronic postnatal MK-801 results in structural plasticity of AIS exclusive to the frontal cortex. EE may modify underlying neuronal mechanisms resulting in restoration of AIS length. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.3645320197044335

Thirty-four college students with high-intermediate English proficiency participated in an eye-tracking experiment and a flanker task. The eye-tracking results show that the participants predict upcoming words, thereby incrementally processing English sentences in a similar manner to L1 speakers. The eye-movement patterns indicate that they actively made use of combinatory information extracted from subject and verb and real-world knowledge. The results from a flanker task, as a measurement of inhibitory controls, reveal that the flanker effect of accuracy, but not the flanker effect of RT, is significantly correlated with anticipatory processing. That is, the participants who responded to the flankers more accurately were better and faster in predicting the target object. In short, our study supports the constraint-based accounts for sentence processing in L2 suggesting that inhibitory controls as an index of cognitive functions can be another constraint on predictive sentence processing. © 2017.

We tested whether: (a) visual and verbal representations have different effects on the deployment of attention; and (b) both types of representations can be used equally in a top-down manner. We asked participants to maintain a visual cue or a verbal cue at the beginning of each trial, and ended with a memory task to ensure that each cue was represented actively in working memory. Before the memory task, a visual search task appeared where validity was manipulated as valid, neutral, or invalid. We also manipulated the probability of valid trials (20%, 50%, and 80%), which had been told to the participants prior to the task. Consistent with earlier findings, attentional guidance by visual representations was modulated by the probability. We also found that this was true for verbal representations, and that these effects did not differ between representation types.

Gaming motives are potentially salient factors of IGD, but research on Chinese gaming motives is scarce. This study empirically evaluated the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Motives for Online Gaming Questionnaire (C-MOGQ), the first inventory that measures seven different gaming motives applicable to all type of online games. We also investigated the associations between various gaming motives and IGD symptoms among Chinese gamers. Methods: Three hundred and eighty-three Chinese adult online gamers (Mean age = 23.7 years) voluntarily completed our online, anonymous survey in December 2015. Results: The confirmatory factor analysis results supported a bi-factormodel with a general factor subsuming all C-MOGQ items (General Motivation) and seven uncorrelated domain-specificfactors (Escape, Coping, Fantasy, Skill Development, Recreation, Competition, and Social). High internal consistencies of the overall scale and subscales were observed. The criterion-related validity of this Chinese version was also supported by the positive correlations of C-MOGQ scale scores with psychological need satisfaction and time spent gaming. Furthermore, we found that high General Motivation (coupled with high Escape motive and low Skill Development motive) was associated with more IGD symptoms reported by our Chinese participants. Discussion and conclusions: Our findings demonstrated the utility of C-MOGQ in measuring gaming motives of Chinese online gamers, and we recommend the consideration of both its total score and subscale scores in future studies. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.49356223175965663

This is not in line with the rich phenomenology of peripheral vision. Here, we investigated a visual illusion that shows that detailed peripheral visual experience is partially based on a reconstruction of reality. Participants fixated on the center of a visual display in which central stimuli differed from peripheral stimuli. Over time, participants perceived that the peripheral stimuli changed to match the central stimuli, so that the display seemed uniform. We showed that a wide range of visual features, including shape, orientation, motion, luminance, pattern, and identity, are susceptible to this uniformity illusion. We argue that the uniformity illusion is the result of a reconstruction of sparse visual information (from the periphery) based on more readily available detailed visual information (from the fovea), which gives rise to a rich, but illusory, experience of peripheral vision. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",0.41139240506329117

To clarify explicit memory's underlying role regarding social influence, we asked participants to evaluate their preference for abstract paintings both before and after observing binary choices made by others whose behaviors could be labeled as trustworthy, neutral, or untrustworthy. The results showed the following: (a) even without explicit memory of who made a choice and which painting was chosen, the participants preferred chosen over unchosen paintings; and (b) such preference changes were modulated by the subjective trustworthiness of others only when they explicitly remembered who made a choice. © 2016 Japanese Psychological Association.

The cardinal neuropathological characteristic of AD is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) into extracellular plaques that ultimately disrupt neuronal function and lead to neurodegeneration. One possible therapeutic strategy therefore is to prevent Aβ aggregation. Previous studies have suggested that vitamin E analogs slow AD progression in humans. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF), a mixture of vitamin E analogs from palm oil, on amyloid pathology in vitro and in vivo. TRF treatment dose-dependently inhibited the formation of Aβ fibrils and Aβ oligomers in vitro. Moreover, daily TRF supplementation to AβPPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice for 10 months attenuated Aβ immunoreactive depositions and thioflavin-S-positive fibrillar type plaques in the brain, and eventually improved cognitive function in the novel object recognition test compared with control AβPPswe/PS1dE9 mice. The present result indicates that TRF reduced amyloid pathology and improved cognitive functions, and suggests that TRF is a potential therapeutic agent for AD. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Tooth loss is one of the alternative evaluation indices of periodontal disease. There are few data on the relationship between tooth loss and memory impairment, depending on the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ϵ4 genotype. Objective: To determine if tooth loss is associated with mild memory impairment (MMI) and if this association is modified by the presence of the APOE ϵ4 allele. Methods: A nested case-control study was conducted from 2007 to 2012 in Japan. Five hundred and thirty-seven Japanese subjects aged 65 years and over who were cognitively intact at baseline were analyzed. MMI at follow-up was evaluated. Results: The median number of teeth at baseline was significantly lower in MMI participants (n = 179) than in controls (n = 358) (MMI: median 21.0, interquartile range 10.0-25.0 versus controls: 24.0, 14.0-27.0). After adjustment for demographics, vascular risk factors, and APOE ϵ4 allele, the multivariate adjusted odds ratio (OR) of ≤8 teeth was 1.97 (95 confidence interval [CI], 1.13-3.44) compared to 25-32 teeth. Participants with both the presence of at least 1 APOE ϵ4 allele and ≤8 teeth had a higher risk of MMI compared with those with neither (OR, 2.82; 95 CI, 1.15-6.91). Those with either risk factor alone did not have a higher risk of MMI. Conclusions: A lower number of teeth is related to risk of MMI.

The results indicate that, like adults, the children know the two constraints, disallowing impossible orderings. The results also show a ranking in the preference of the possible orderings.

Previous studies have demonstrated that target direction information presented by the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during movement planning could be incorporated into neural decoder for achieving better decoding performance. It is still unknown whether the neural decoder combined with only target direction could work in more complex tasks where obstacles impeded direct reaching paths. Methods. In this study, spike activities were collected from the PMd of two monkeys when performing a delayed obstacle-avoidance task. We examined how target direction and intended movement selection were encoded in neuron population activities of the PMd during movement planning. The decoding performances of movement trajectory were compared for three neural decoders with no prior knowledge, or only target direction, or both target direction and intended movement selection integrated into a mixture of trajectory model (MTM). Results. We found that not only target direction but also intended movement selection was presented in neural activities of the PMd during movement planning. It was further confirmed by quantitative analysis. Combined with prior knowledge, the trajectory decoder achieved the best performance among three decoders. Conclusion. Recruiting prior knowledge about target direction and intended movement selection extracted from the PMd could enhance the decoding performance of hand trajectory in indirect reaching movement. © 2017 Hongbao Li et al.",0.4326923076923077

Cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) has been considered to play a central role in the activation step, which is essential for the formation of DNA adducts. This enzyme is strongly induced by many different chemical agents, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), which binds to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Therefore, AhR activators are suspected to have the potential to aggravate the toxicity of BaP through the induction of CYP1A1. Besides, CYP1A1 inhibitors, including its substrates, are estimated to have preventive effects against BaP toxicity. However, strangely, increased hepatic BaP–DNA adduct levels have been reported in Cyp1a1 knockout mice. Moreover, numerous reports describe that concomitant treatment of AhR activators reduced BaP–DNA adduct formation. In an experiment using several human cell lines, TCDD had diverse modulatory effects on BaP–DNA adducts, both enhancing and inhibiting their formation. In this review, we focus on the factors that could influence the BaP–DNA adduct formation. To interpret these complicated outcomes, we propose a hypothesis that CYP1A1 is a key enzyme for both generation and reduction of (±)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), the major carcinogenic intermediate of BaP. Conversely, CYP1B1 is thought to contribute only to the metabolic activation of BaP related to carcinogenesis. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.3300970873786408
Communication technology use for work at home during off-job time and work-family conflict: The roles of family support and psychological detachment; [Uso de la tecnología de comunicación para el trabajo en casa durante el tiempo fuera del trabajo y el conflicto trabajo-familia: Los roles del apoyo familiar y el desapego psicológico],2017,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007602663&doi=10.6018%2fanalesps.33.1.238581&partnerID=40&md5=42561801aa69cf9ec06495fe9743fe2f,"This study analyzes the influence of communication technology use for work at home during off-job time on work-family conflict. Our analysis is based on work-family border theory. Moreover, this study highlights the roles of psychological detachment and family support. Based on 423 samples, we use regression analysis to test our hypotheses. Results show that communication technology use for work at home during off-job time is related to employee work-family conflict positively, including timebased and strain-based conflicts. Family support moderates the effect of communication technology use for work at home during off-job time on employee work-family conflict. Furthermore, psychological detachment mediates the moderating effect of family support on the relationship between communication technology use for work at home during off-job time and employee work-family conflict. © 2017: Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.",0.4961832061068702
Recent Increases in Hippocampal Tau Pathology in the Aging Japanese Population: The Hisayama Study,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84999280672&doi=10.3233%2fJAD-160521&partnerID=40&md5=0060c10e234236342d92b7555f320896,"Background: The Hisayama study is a prospective cohort study of lifestyle-related diseases that commenced in 1961. Through it, a significant increasing trend in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease has been observed over the past 18 years. Objectives: We sought to investigate the increases in brain pathology related to Alzheimer's disease using automated MATLAB morphometric analyses for quantifying tau pathology. Methods: We examined a series of autopsied cases from Hisayama residents obtained between 1998 and 2003 (group A: 203 cases), and between 2009 and 2014 (group B: 232 cases). We developed custom software in MATLAB to analyze abnormal tau deposits quantitatively. Specimens were immunostained with both anti-amyloid-β-protein and anti-phosphorylated tau antibodies. Results: Both the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria for senile plaques and Braak stage for NFT were higher in group B. Morphometric analyses of the hippocampi also revealed a trend toward increased tau pathology in both men and women over 80 years of age in group B. The increases were also significant when the subjects were examined independently according to high or low CERAD scores and in all levels of AD neuropathologic change according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines (2012). Conclusion: We revealed a recent trend of increased tauopathy in the older people, which is partly independent of amyloid-β pathology. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Attentional Capture by Emotional Stimuli: Manipulation of Emotional Valence by the Sample Pre-rating Method,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007618850&doi=10.1111%2fjpr.12142&partnerID=40&md5=bab30f3310173801962746e09e666f18,"Eye movements directed at emotional and neutral pictures were investigated. Participants were instructed to fixate on a target and avoid looking at a non-target. Results of trials consisting of emotional and neutral pictures were analyzed based on participants’ evaluations of the stimuli before the experiment. Results indicated that the number and duration of fixations were larger and longer for targets than for non-targets. Further, the probability of first fixation was less for neutral targets than for emotional targets. This suggests that unpleasant pictures capture visual attention and that the attentional orienting is subject to automatic response. The possibility that top-down processes of visual attention may be involved in attentional capture was also discussed. © 2016 Japanese Psychological Association.

"Roles of Self-Stigma, Social Support, and Positive and Negative Affects as Determinants of Depressive Symptoms Among HIV Infected Men who have Sex with Men in China",2017,74,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958745740&doi=10.1007%2fs10461-016-1321-1&partnerID=40&md5=abd412eb266b13fba82c2a03a2ef8c99,"Poor mental health was prevalent among HIV positive men who have sex with men (HIVMSM), and a tremendous burden extents on their families and society. The present study investigated the prevalence of depression and its relationship with social support, HIV self-stigma, positive affect and negative affect among 321 HIVMSM in Chengdu, China. The study was conducted during July 2013 through October 2013. Findings showed that 55.8 % of the participants had mild to severe depression. The results of structural equation modeling showed that social support and positive affect were negatively associated with depression, while HIV self-stigma and negative affect were positively associated with depression. Social support, positive affect, and negative affect mediated the association between HIV self-stigma and depression. The hypothesized model had a satisfactory fit. Interventions improving mental health among this population are warranted. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0.5555555555555556
Avoidance behavior associated with depressive symptoms in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators; [Conducta de evitación asociada a síntomas depresivos en pacientes con desfibriladores cardioversores implantables],2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006990981&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijchp.2016.11.001&partnerID=40&md5=02f31b3397689224b40cb518efad828b,"Objective: Many patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators experience depressive symptoms. In addition, avoidance behavior is a common problem among patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators. We examined the association between avoidance behaviors and depressive symptoms in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Method: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional study with self-completed questionnaires between May 2010 and March 2011. We measured avoidance behaviors (avoidance of places, avoidance of objects, and avoidance of situations) and depressive symptoms (using the Beck Depression Inventory, Version II) in 119 participants. An avoidance behaviors instrument was developed for this study and we confirmed its internal consistency reliability. Results: Ninety-two (77.3%) patients were aged older than 50 years, and 86 (72.3%) were men. Fifty-one (42.9%) patients reported “avoidance of places”, 34 (28.6%) reported “avoidance of objects”, and 63 (52.9%) reported “avoidance of activity”. Avoidance behavior was associated with increased odds for the presence of depressive symptoms (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.06–1.62). Conclusions: This was the first study to identify the relationship between avoidance behavior and depressive symptoms among patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators; however, there are a few methodological limitations. © 2016 Asociación Española de Psicología Conductual",0.4093567251461988
Childhood bullying victimization is associated with use of mental health services over five decades: A longitudinal nationally representative cohort study,2017,68,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988712342&doi=10.1017%2fS0033291716001719&partnerID=40&md5=6c4f43bf6a76fddab0ff4ecdc17ed150,"Background. Research supports robust associations between childhood bullying victimization and mental health problems in childhood/adolescence and emerging evidence shows that the impact can persist into adulthood. We examined the impact of bullying victimization on mental health service use from childhood to midlife. Method. We performed secondary analysis using the National Child Development Study, the 1958 British Birth Cohort Study. We conducted analyses on 9242 participants with complete data on childhood bullying victimization and service use at midlife. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations between childhood bullying victimization and mental health service use at the ages of 16, 23, 33, 42 and 50 years. We estimated incidence and persistence of mental health service use over time to the age of 50 years. Results. Compared with participants who were not bullied in childhood, those who were frequently bullied were more likely to use mental health services in childhood and adolescence [odds ratio (OR) 2.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88-3.40] and also in midlife (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.55). Disparity in service use associated with childhood bullying victimization was accounted for by both incident service use through to age 33 years by a subgroup of participants, and by persistent use up to midlife. Conclusions. Childhood bullying victimization adds to the pressure on an already stretched health care system. Policy and practice efforts providing support for victims of bullying could help contain public sector costs. Given constrained budgets and the long-term mental health impact on victims of bullying, early prevention strategies could be effective at limiting both individual distress and later costs. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.",0.4819277108433735
Longitudinal changes in academic motivation in Japan: Self-determination theory and East Asian cultures,2017,22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007605381&doi=10.1016%2fj.appdev.2016.11.004&partnerID=40&md5=82b512acf7783a052fe76a2131a1d466,"This study examined changes in the academic motivation of Japanese junior high school students through a two-year longitudinal survey, based on self-determination theory. Japanese students (N = 410; 215 boys and 195 girls aged 12–13 years at the time of the first survey) completed the Japanese short-version of the Self-Regulation Questionnaire once each year during three consecutive grades (seventh, eighth, and ninth). The results of a latent curve model indicated that intrinsic and identified regulation (i.e., autonomous motivation) decreased and extrinsic and introjected regulation (i.e., controlled motivation) increased during junior high school. The results of ANOVA revealed the specific period during which academic motivation changed. In addition, a growth mixture model detected two characteristic profiles concerning motivational change: some students showed only decreases in autonomous motivation and others showed only increases in controlled motivation. Japanese junior high school student' motivation shifted from autonomous to controlled, but they did not become less motivated overall. © 2016 The Authors",0.47333333333333333
Supporting Japanese Mothers of Children with ADHD: Cultural Adaptation of the New Forest Parent Training Programme,2017,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007575178&doi=10.1111%2fjpr.12140&partnerID=40&md5=f490d9472d61a7a44886a5e27d68db79,"International practice guidelines recommend medication and behavioral intervention as evidenced-based treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Currently in Japan, the availability of non-pharmacological interventions for ADHD is limited. We report the results of a pilot and a proof-of-concept study for a new behavioral intervention for Japanese mothers of children with ADHD. The pilot study delivered a standard six-session behavioral intervention and two parent-support sessions. Participants approved the group format and requested additional support to change parenting practices and behavioral strategies targeting ADHD symptoms. For the proof-of-concept study, the intervention was revised to include five sessions of pre-intervention support followed by six sessions of the New Forest Parent Training Programme (NFPP), an evidence-based intervention for ADHD. The revised intervention, NFPP-Japan, was associated with reductions in the mothers’ reports of children's ADHD symptoms and aggression, more effective parenting practices, and reduced parenting stress. The pilot and proof-of-concept studies indicate that it is possible to successfully modify Western behavioral interventions for Japanese mothers and to justify a randomized controlled trial evaluation of the NFPP-Japan, which is currently underway. © 2016 Japanese Psychological Association.

Temporal organization of sound information in auditory memory,2017,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020864417&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00999&partnerID=40&md5=00531df64c580179f3d6fbfe075b8fdf,"Memory is a constructive and organizational process. Instead of being stored with all the fine details, external information is reorganized and structured at certain spatiotemporal scales. It is well acknowledged that time plays a central role in audition by segmenting sound inputs into temporal chunks of appropriate length. However, it remains largely unknown whether critical temporal structures exist to mediate sound representation in auditory memory. To address the issue, here we designed an auditory memory transferring study, by combining a previously developed unsupervised white noise memory paradigm with a reversed sound manipulation method. Specifically, we systematically measured the memory transferring from a random white noise sound to its locally temporal reversed version on various temporal scales in seven experiments. We demonstrate a U-shape memory-transferring pattern with the minimum value around temporal scale of 200 ms. Furthermore, neither auditory perceptual similarity nor physical similarity as a function of the manipulating temporal scale can account for the memory-transferring results. Our results suggest that sounds are not stored with all the fine spectrotemporal details but are organized and structured at discrete temporal chunks in long-term auditory memory representation. © 2017 Song and Luo.",0.49732620320855614
Assessing Associations Between Changes in Risk and Subsequent Reoffending: An Introduction to Relevant Statistical Models,2017,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008253074&doi=10.1177%2f0093854816678648&partnerID=40&md5=1abff7aaa7d0515d3e16ba9fc7dee91c,"Research on recidivism prediction has made important advances, but the same cannot be said of research assessing relationships between risk changes over time or after treatment and subsequent reoffending. In realistic criminal justice situations, data linking changes in risk to recidivism are often fraught with problems due to missing data, irregular intervals in repeat risk assessments, and individual differences such as age and risk levels. Traditional statistical methodologies such as ANCOVA for repeated measures are not suited for analyzing data with these features. We presented four types of statistical modeling techniques that can effectively accommodate these noisier data: conventional regression, conditional regression, two-stage, and joint models. The two-stage models consist of multilevel growth model and conventional regression. The joint models refer to structural equational models. Two example data sets were used to illustrate the application of these methodologies. © 2016, © 2016 International Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology.",0.5448275862068965
